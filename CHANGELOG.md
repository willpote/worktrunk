# Changelog

## 0.31.0

### Improved

- **Hooks rationalized**: Every lifecycle event now has a symmetric `pre-` (blocking) / `post-` (background) pair. This required one rename: `post-create` → `pre-start`, reflecting that it runs *before* `post-start` as a blocking dependency step. A new `post-commit` hook fires in the background after commits (including squash commits during merge). `post-merge` is now background instead of blocking, consistent with all other `post-*` hooks. Configs using `post-create` get a deprecation warning on any `wt` command; run `wt config update` to rename automatically. The old name continues to work during the deprecation period. ([#1679](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1679), closes [#1670](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1670))

- **Hook template variables consolidated**: Bare variables (`branch`, `worktree_path`, `commit`) now consistently point to the Active worktree — the destination for switch/create, the source for merge/remove. New directional variables (`{{ base }}`, `{{ base_worktree_path }}`, `{{ target_worktree_path }}`, `{{ cwd }}`) give hooks explicit access to both sides of two-worktree operations. (Breaking: `{{ worktree_path }}` changed in pre-switch for existing worktrees and in post-merge — use `{{ cwd }}` or `{{ base_worktree_path }}` for the previous behavior.) [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/) ([#1655](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1655), [#1660](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1660), [#1663](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1663))

- **Bare repo worktree-path prompt**: When a bare repo lives at a hidden path like `.git` or `.bare`, `wt switch` now detects that worktrees would get awkward names (e.g., `project/.git.feature`) and offers to configure a `worktree-path` override. Non-interactive environments show the config to add manually. ([#1656](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1656), thanks @seakayone for reporting [#1279](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1279))

- **Shell completion for step aliases**: Tab-completing `wt step <TAB>` now shows configured aliases alongside built-in step commands, with `--dry-run`, `--yes`, and `--var` flags. ([#1641](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1641))

- **`wt list` reclaims space from redundant columns**: When the Path column carries no useful information (all worktree paths are predictable from branch names), its space is reclaimed for Summary and Message. ([#1634](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1634))

- **Syntax highlighting for alias dry-run**: `wt step <alias> --dry-run` now uses bash syntax highlighting, matching hook dry-run output. ([#1635](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1635))

### Fixed

- **`wt list` hang from fsmonitor daemon**: On macOS with builtin fsmonitor, `wt list` could hang at the "(loading...)" stage because `git fsmonitor--daemon start` inherited pipe file descriptors and held them open indefinitely. ([#1648](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1648))

- **Post-remove hooks ran at wrong directory**: Post-remove hooks executed at the user's cwd (which could be the worktree being removed) instead of the primary worktree. ([#1645](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1645))

- **Picker showed loading indicator for unavailable data**: The interactive picker used `⋯` (loading) for fields that would never arrive; now uses `·` (unavailable). ([#1651](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1651))

- **`wt hook --dry-run` missing directional variables**: Hook dry-run and `--show --expanded` output was missing `base`, `target`, and `target_worktree_path` variables for switch, create, and remove hooks. ([#1669](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1669))

### Documentation

- Bare repository layout guide and `worktree-path` example in config docs. ([#1664](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1664))

- Migration guide for template variable changes in hook docs. ([#1666](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1666))

### Internal

- Renamed internal `select` module to `picker`. ([#1650](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1650))

- Consolidated merge/remove removal validation. ([#1625](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1625))

## 0.30.1

### Fixed

- **Narrow terminal layout**: `wt switch` picker now uses vertical (Down) layout on terminals narrower than 80 columns, and the Branch column shrinks instead of being dropped — branch names are always visible. ([#1564](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1564), [#1626](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1626), thanks @armstrjare for reporting [#1563](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1563))

- **Bash tab completion showed all branches**: `wt switch feat<TAB>` displayed every branch instead of filtering by prefix, prompting "Display all N possibilities?" for users with many branches. Fish and zsh still use their native substring/fuzzy matching. ([#1622](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1622), thanks @altruic for reporting [#1621](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1621))

- **Hook command completion pre-filtered in all shells**: `HookCommandCompleter` filtered by prefix before returning candidates, preventing fish/zsh substring matching on hook command names. ([#1627](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1627))

- **`wt merge` failed with `submodule.recurse=true`**: Users with `submodule.recurse=true` in their git config saw push errors during merge. Local push now passes `--recurse-submodules=no`. ([#1619](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1619), thanks @viicslen for reporting [#1604](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1604))

- **Worktree sync uses safe `read-tree`**: Target worktree sync after `--no-ff` push uses `read-tree -m -u` instead of `reset --hard`, consistent with the project's norms. ([#1623](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1623))

### Internal

- Inlined `complete_branches` and `complete_hook_commands` into their respective completers. ([#1628](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1628), [#1627](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1627))

## 0.30.0

### Improved

- **`wt merge --no-ff`**: Create a merge commit instead of fast-forwarding, for semi-linear history (rebased commits plus a merge commit). Also available as `merge.no-ff = true` in user config. [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/merge/) ([#1438](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1438), thanks @siriobalmelli)

- **`wt step eval`** [experimental]: Evaluate template expressions from the command line. All hook variables (`branch`, `repo`, `worktree_path`) and filters (`hash_port`, `sanitize`, `sanitize_db`) are available. Designed for scripting: `curl http://localhost:$(wt step eval '{{ branch | hash_port }}')/health`. [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/step/) ([#1004](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1004), thanks @EduardoSimon for the feature request in [#947](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/947))

- **`wt step push --no-ff`**: Mirrors `wt merge --no-ff` for manual step-by-step workflows: `wt step commit && wt step rebase && wt step push --no-ff`. ([#1587](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1587))

- **Worktree removal now hidden**: Removed worktrees are staged in `.git/wt/trash/` instead of a visible `.wt-removing-*` sibling directory. All worktrunk state consolidated under `.git/wt/`. ([#1583](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1583), thanks @ortonomy for reporting [#1572](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1572))

### Fixed

- **`wt merge` could remove the default branch worktree in bare repos**: In bare repository layouts, merging from the default branch worktree could remove it instead of preserving it. ([#1620](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1620), thanks @viicslen for reporting [#1618](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1618))

- **`wt switch` panicked on empty picker selection**: Entering a non-existent branch name in the interactive picker caused a panic. Now returns an error message gracefully. ([#1566](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1566), thanks @dlnilsson for reporting [#1565](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1565))

- **`copy-ignored` lost directory permissions**: Source directory permissions (e.g., mode 0700 for Postgres data directories) were replaced with default 0755. ([#1590](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1590), thanks @RileyMathews for reporting [#1589](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1589))

- **`copy-ignored` failed on broken symlinks at destination**: If a gitignored file's destination was already an invalid symlink, the copy failed with "No such file or directory". ([#1549](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1549), thanks @armstrjare for reporting [#1547](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1547))

- **Nushell `$env.PWD` errors after `wt remove`**: Removing a worktree from inside it produced repeated `$env.PWD points to a non-existent directory` errors in Nushell. ([#1508](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1508), thanks @mystilleef for reporting [#1507](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1507))

- **Remote URL used `insteadOf` rewrites**: `wt list` and PR detection used the rewritten remote URL instead of the raw config value, causing mismatches with CI and forge detection. ([#1546](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1546), thanks @volkanbicer)

- **SIGPIPE from pager quit treated as error**: Quitting a pager (e.g., `q` in `less`) during `wt step diff` showed "terminated by signal 13" instead of exiting cleanly. ([#1559](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1559))

- **Missing vs corrupt git config errors conflated**: Missing config keys and corrupt config files both returned the same error, making corrupt configurations hard to diagnose. ([#1610](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1610))

- **Shell operator precedence in remove command**: The `|| true` for fsmonitor stop had incorrect precedence, potentially swallowing failures from the entire removal chain. ([#1584](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1584))

- **Missing shell escaping in error hints**: Branch names and paths in suggested `cd ... && git switch ...` commands were not shell-escaped. ([#1584](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1584))

### Documentation

- **pnpm post-create example**: Added a recipe for running `pnpm install` after worktree creation via `copy-ignored`. ([#1581](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1581))

- **Hook execution order**: Clarified that post-create hooks run before post-start hooks. ([#1573](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1573))

## 0.29.4

### Improved

- **Destination branch in pre-switch hooks**: `{{ branch }}` in pre-switch hooks now expands to the **destination** branch (as typed by the user) instead of the source worktree's branch. Previously, pre-switch hooks could only see where you were, not where you were going. [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/) ([#1497](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1497), thanks @mayureshwaykole for the discussion in [#1494](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1494))

- **LLM tool commands in example config**: `wt config create` now includes double-commented entries for Claude, Codex, opencode, llm, and aichat commands, making them discoverable without reading the docs. [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/llm-commits/) ([#1531](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1531), [#1533](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1533))

### Fixed

- **Extra blank line in `config create` output**: The success path printed a blank line between the success message and hint lines, inconsistent with the "already exists" path. ([#1525](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1525))

### Documentation

- **Switch docs**: Trimmed upstream tracking paragraph, added missing `pre-switch`/`post-switch` hooks to creation lifecycle, combined GitHub/GitLab sections. ([#1521](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1521))

- **List docs**: Restored `--full` prerequisite note for LLM summaries. ([#1517](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1517))

- **Experimental badges in headings**: Moved experimental badges from description paragraphs to headings in web docs for cleaner TOC entries. ([#1523](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1523))

### Internal

- **CI improvements**: Prevented duplicate inline review comments across cycles, banned blocking `gh pr checks --watch`, fixed verify step for concurrency-cancelled runs, stopped hourly audit from flagging CI polling, added rolling file survey to nightly cleaner. ([#1514](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1514), [#1498](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1498), [#1519](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1519), [#1520](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1520), [#1522](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1522))

- **Simplified review-pr skill**: Cut metacognitive coaching and collapsed confidence tiers; 504 → 369 lines (−27%). ([#1530](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1530))

## 0.29.3

### Improved

- **Unified timeout model for list and picker**: Consolidated the picker's per-command timeout and list's experimental `timeout-ms` into a shared config with `[list] task-timeout-ms` (per-task, shared by both) and per-context wall-clock budgets (`[list] timeout-ms`, `[switch.picker] timeout-ms`). Picker default budget raised from 200ms per-command to 500ms wall-clock. ([#1515](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1515), [#1487](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1487))

- **Pre-flight template validation for `wt switch`**: Switch templates (`--execute` and hook commands) are now validated before worktree creation, preventing orphan worktrees from syntax errors like `{{ unclosed`. ([#1500](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1500))

### Fixed

- **`wt remove` allowed removing default branch worktree**: The default branch worktree (e.g., main) could be removed because it was trivially "integrated" into itself. Now blocked unless `-D` is used. ([#1460](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1460), thanks @cperalt for reporting [#1448](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1448))

- **Symlinks copied as regular files in `copy-ignored`**: Top-level gitignored symlinks were copied as regular files instead of preserved as symlinks, breaking setups like Yarn monorepos. ([#1489](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1489), thanks @karmeleon for reporting [#1488](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1488))

- **Missing placeholders in WorkingDiff and Upstream columns**: These columns showed blank instead of `⋯`/`·` placeholders when data wasn't loaded, breaking the visual loading signal. ([#1503](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1503))

### Documentation

- **Step command docs**: Added promote subdoc, improved swap description, linked Operations index to subcommand sections, moved aliases section after subcommands, fixed cross-filesystem fallback description. ([#1505](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1505), [#1495](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1495), [#1502](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1502), [#1513](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1513))

- **List docs**: Documented placeholder symbols (`⋯`, `·`) in help text, rewrote LLM summaries section. ([#1496](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1496), [#1506](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1506))

- **Homepage**: Added headline features (CI status, PR checkout, hash_port) and tips link. ([#1501](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1501))

- **Experimental badge pills**: Styled `[experimental]` markers as pill badges in web docs. ([#1499](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1499))

### Internal

- **Deduplicated hook config resolution**: Extracted shared hook-type list and made `lookup_hook_configs` pub(crate). ([#1512](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1512))

- **Agent Skills metadata**: Added `metadata.internal: true` to repo-scoped skills so `npx skills add` only offers user-facing ones. ([#1491](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1491))

## 0.29.2

### Improved

- **`[switch] no-cd` config option**: Disable directory change by default with `no-cd = true` in the `[switch]` section. Use `--cd` flag to override when needed. Useful for tmux workflows where sessions handle navigation. [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/config/) ([#1401](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1401), thanks @jradtilbrook)

### Fixed

- **GPG signature output breaks `wt list`**: When `log.showSignature` is set in git config, GPG verification lines contaminated stdout in `git log` calls, causing parse failures. All git log invocations now pass `--no-show-signature`. ([#1465](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1465), thanks @apre)

- **Tab completions ignore shell substring matching**: The binary was prefix-filtering branch candidates before returning them to the shell, preventing fish substring matching (`auth<TAB>` → `feature/user-auth`) and zsh fuzzy matching. Completions now return all candidates and let the shell apply its own matching. ([#1471](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1471), thanks @benjaminbauer for reporting [#1468](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1468))

- **Tab completions unusable in large repos**: Repos with many remote branches triggered the "do you wish to see all N possibilities?" prompt. Remote-only branches are now excluded when the total exceeds 100. ([#1442](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1442), thanks @cperalt for reporting [#1415](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1415))

- **Nushell shell integration broken in Home Manager module**: The Nix Home Manager module used `use` instead of `source` for the nushell init script, and template definitions were not exported, preventing the `wt` wrapper function from loading. ([#1476](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1476), thanks @mystilleef for reporting [#1475](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1475))

### Documentation

- **Manual commit message recipes**: Added recipes to Tips & Patterns for using `commit.generation.command` config to write commit messages by hand with `$EDITOR` instead of an LLM. ([#1469](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1469), thanks @viicslen for the feature request in [#1467](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1467))

### Internal

- **Skill/CI guidance**: Improved Claude bot skills for triage, code review, and CI monitoring. ([#1485](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1485), [#1477](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1477), [#1474](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1474), [#1472](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1472), [#1470](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1470), [#1458](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1458), [#1447](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1447))

## 0.29.1

### Improved

- **GitHub Enterprise support for `wt switch`**: `wt switch pr:<number>` now works with GitHub Enterprise instances by extracting the hostname from the remote URL and passing `--hostname` to `gh`. ([#1408](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1408), thanks @TomRomeo)

- **`wt switch --no-cd` print mode**: When `wt switch --no-cd` opens the interactive picker (no branch argument), selecting a branch prints its name to stdout and exits — useful for scripting. ([#1445](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1445), thanks @ruudk for the feature request in [#1404](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1404))

- **Shadow warning for step aliases**: `wt step` now warns when a user-defined alias has the same name as a built-in step command (e.g., `commit`, `rebase`), since clap intercepts the built-in before the alias runs. ([#1389](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1389))

### Fixed

- **Post-switch hooks on `wt remove`**: When removing the current worktree, post-switch hooks now fire correctly as the user is implicitly switched to the primary worktree. Previously, project hooks were silently skipped because config lookup failed from the removed CWD. ([#1452](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1452), thanks @mjakl for reporting [#1450](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1450))

- **LLM commit session isolation**: The recommended Claude command for commit generation now includes `--no-session-persistence`, preventing commit conversations from polluting `claude --continue`. ([#1454](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1454))

- **Color formatting in error messages**: `DetachedHead` and `NotInWorktree` error messages now support color-print styling, matching other error variants. ([#1387](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1387))

- **Windows error handling**: Replaced `std::process::exit()` with proper error returns in Windows-specific code paths, so destructors and cleanup run correctly. ([#1456](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1456))

### Documentation

- **Hook JSON context section**: Fixed documentation that incorrectly described `hook_type` and `hook_name` as extras; added the TOML hook definition showing how JSON stdin is wired. ([#1360](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1360))

- **`wt remove` help text**: Updated example heading to clarify that `wt remove` works on both worktrees and branches. ([#1449](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1449))

- **Xcode DerivedData cleanup recipe**: Added recipe for cleaning Xcode build artifacts across worktrees. ([#1423](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1423), thanks @RickeyBoy)

### Internal

- **Refactoring**: Extracted handler functions from `main()` dispatch, replaced negated boolean variables with positive-polarity names (`no_verify` → `verify`, `no_delete_branch` → `keep_branch`). ([#1394](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1394), [#1388](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1388), [#1393](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1393))

- **Test reliability**: Resolved flaky PTY/timing issues in integration tests, consolidated trivial tests into inline snapshots. ([#1459](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1459), [#1392](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1392), [#1382](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1382), [#1390](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1390))

- **CI**: Added Zola docs validation to PR checks, catching broken internal anchor links before merge. ([#1396](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1396))

## 0.29.0

### Improved

- **`wt step <alias>` command**: User-defined command templates with template variables (`{{ branch }}`, `{{ worktree }}`, custom `--var KEY=VALUE`). Project-config aliases require approval; user-config aliases are trusted. [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/step/) ([#1348](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1348), thanks @cavanaug for the feature request in [#1214](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1214))

- **Remove worktrees from switch picker**: `alt-r` in `wt switch` interactive picker removes the highlighted worktree directly (no force flags — matches safety defaults). ([#1253](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1253), thanks @alfredomtx for the feature request in [#1251](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1251))

- **`wt hook <type> --dry-run`**: Preview hook expansion with template variables resolved, without executing. ([#1361](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1361))

- **Hook template variables**: `{{ hook_type }}` and `{{ hook_name }}` are now available in hook command templates. ([#1364](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1364))

- **Typo suggestions for step commands**: Unknown step commands and aliases now suggest the closest match. ([#1363](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1363))

- **Syntax-highlighted `--help`**: Code blocks in `--help` output now render with language-aware syntax highlighting (TOML, bash) instead of plain dimmed text. Help options are grouped under navigational headings (Picker Options, Automation). ([#1365](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1365), [#1355](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1355), [#1359](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1359))

- **Nix Home Manager module**: Install worktrunk via Nix Home Manager. ([#1287](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1287), thanks @DuskyElf; thanks @meicale for reporting [#1257](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1257))

- **Output styling**: Bold names replace quoted names in error messages, underlined references replace bright-black in hints, `@ path` convention unified in section headings, and branch-worktree mismatch warnings now show both actual and expected paths. ([#1375](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1375), [#1380](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1380), [#1285](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1285), [#1376](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1376), [#1377](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1377), thanks @jhigh2000 for reporting [#1184](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1184))

### Fixed

- **`--no-cd` with interactive picker**: The `--no-cd` flag is now passed through when using `wt switch` with the interactive picker. ([#1331](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1331), thanks @cperalt for reporting [#1330](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1330))

- **Remote branches with `/` in picker**: `wt switch --remotes` now correctly handles remote branches with `/` in the name (e.g., `origin/user/feature`). ([#1266](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1266), thanks @curtbushko for reporting [#1260](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1260))

- **Nushell config path on Windows**: `wt config shell install` now uses the platform-appropriate config directory for nushell on Windows. ([#1294](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1294), thanks @deltoss for reporting [#1293](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1293))

- **Git for Windows per-user install**: Detect per-user Git for Windows installations and show a clean error message instead of panicking when Git Bash is not found. ([#1261](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1261), [#1262](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1262), thanks @JefMasereel for reporting [#1259](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1259))

- **JSON output `summary` field**: `wt list --format=json` now includes the `summary` field. ([#1339](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1339))

- **Squash merge message**: Uses source branch name instead of target branch in the merge commit message. ([#1319](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1319), thanks @ricafeal)

- **Alias approval errors**: Propagate the real error (e.g., "no remote URL found") instead of a vague "Cannot determine project identifier". ([#1374](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1374))

- **`wt step prune` output**: Summary uses cleaner paired format ("Pruned 1 worktree & branch") and fixes post-remove hook display path for non-current worktrees. ([#1344](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1344))

- **VCS metadata in `copy-ignored`**: Exclude `.git`, `.hg`, `.svn`, `_darcs` directories from `wt step copy-ignored`. ([#1250](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1250))

- **Nix evaluation warning**: Use `stdenv.hostPlatform.system` instead of deprecated `system`. ([#1336](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1336), thanks @onelocked)

### Documentation

- **Home page SEO**: Canonical URL deduplication and consistent tagline. ([#1357](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1357))

- **LLM commit tools**: Add opencode and consolidate other LLM commit tool references. ([#1295](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1295))

### Internal

- **Git plumbing**: Replace porcelain commands with plumbing alternatives (`rev-parse --symbolic-full-name`, `log --no-walk`, `for-each-ref`) for more robust output parsing. Cache deprecated-variable regexes and fix silent wrong results in `same_commit()`/`trees_match()`. ([#1345](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1345), [#1338](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1338), [#1358](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1358))

- **Error propagation**: `repo_path()` and `ShellConfig::get()` now return `Result` instead of silently falling back. ([#1280](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1280), [#1262](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1262))

- **CI improvements**: Consolidated setup into composite action, replaced `gh run watch` with poll loops, added conflict resolution for bot PRs in nightly cleaner. ([#1273](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1273), [#1329](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1329), [#1307](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1307))

## 0.28.2

### Improved

- **`wt step prune` output**: Dirty or locked worktrees are silently skipped instead of printing warnings, and "No worktree found for branch" info messages are suppressed — prune output now shows only what was actually removed. ([#1236](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1236))

### Fixed

- **CWD removal hint**: After a worktree is removed while a shell is in that directory, the hint now checks whether `wt switch ^` would actually work before suggesting it — falls back to suggesting `wt list` when the default branch worktree doesn't exist (e.g., bare repos). ([#1238](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1238), thanks @davidbeesley for reporting [#1168](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1168))

- **Submodule detection in worktree removal**: Submodule detection now uses `git submodule status` output instead of parsing error messages, avoiding locale-dependent and version-dependent string matching. ([#1247](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1247))

### Internal

- **Hook dispatch**: Introduced `HookCommandSpec` struct and extracted helper functions to deduplicate hook dispatch code (~50 lines net reduction). ([#1248](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1248))

- **CI skills**: Fixed jq escaping in ad-hoc CI polling queries and improved Step 5 dismissal ordering in pr-review skill. ([#1241](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1241), [#1246](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1246))

## 0.28.1

### Improved

- **Nushell tab completions**: `wt switch <TAB>` and subcommand completions now work in nushell. ([#1220](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1220), thanks @omerxx for reporting [#1215](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1215))

- **`wt step prune` reliability**: Candidates are now removed inline as they're discovered instead of scan-then-remove, with per-candidate error handling (dirty worktrees are warned and skipped). Dry-run and execution summaries now distinguish worktrees, branches, and detached worktrees. Command marked `[experimental]`. ([#1234](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1234), [#1232](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1232), [#1223](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1223))

- **`wt step diff` performance**: Copies the real git index instead of creating an empty one, preserving git's stat cache so unchanged tracked files are skipped. ([#1230](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1230))

### Fixed

- **Branch delete race on fast-path remove**: `wt remove` now deletes merged branches synchronously on the fast path instead of deferring to the background process, fixing a race where `wt switch --create <branch>` fails with "branch already exists". ([#1216](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1216))

- **Panic in `is_bare()` on unusual repositories**: `is_bare()` now propagates errors instead of panicking. ([#1221](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1221), @bendrucker)

- **Help text table coloring**: Status symbols and backtick-enclosed text in `--help` tables now render with proper ANSI colors. ([#1231](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1231))

### Internal

- **CI workflow**: Added concurrency group to claude-mention workflow, fixed external contributor PR review permissions. ([#1233](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1233), [#1226](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1226))

## 0.28.0

### Improved

- **`wt step prune` command**: Remove worktrees whose branches are already merged into the default branch. Skips unmerged and recently created worktrees, with `--min-age` to control the staleness threshold. [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/step/) ([#1191](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1191))

- **Color palette in `wt config shell show-theme`**: Shows each color and style rendered in itself — base colors, modifiers, bold+color and dim+color variants — for diagnosing legibility issues on different terminal themes. ([#1185](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1185), thanks @jhigh2000 for reporting [#1184](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1184))

- **Smarter column layout in `wt list`**: The Message column is hidden when the terminal is too narrow for Summary to reach 40 characters, preventing both columns from being truncated to unreadable widths. ([#1166](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1166))

### Fixed

- **Submodules in worktree removal**: `wt remove` now handles worktrees containing initialized git submodules, which previously failed with "working trees containing submodules cannot be moved or removed". ([#1196](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1196), thanks @dlecan for reporting [#1194](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1194))

- **CWD recovery validation**: Recovery from a deleted worktree directory now validates that candidate repositories actually contain the deleted path as a worktree, preventing false matches when multiple repos share a parent directory. ([#1193](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1193))

- **Shell-escape paths in `-C` flag hints**: Paths containing spaces or special characters in `-C` hints are now properly shell-escaped. ([#1173](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1173))

- **ANSI handling in CWD recovery**: Recovery messages now use `anstream` for proper ANSI handling on terminals that don't support color. ([#1183](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1183))

- **Worktree path in detached HEAD removal messages**: Removal output for detached HEAD worktrees now includes the worktree path for clarity. ([#1210](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1210))

- **Pruned worktree output**: Worktree and branch deletion for pruned worktrees are combined into a single output line instead of two separate messages. ([#1211](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1211))

### Documentation

- **Page metadata and SEO**: All doc pages now have `<meta name="description">`, canonical URLs, and structured data (JSON-LD) for better search engine visibility. ([#1167](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1167))

### Internal

- **CI bot improvements**: Inline suggestions, confidence-based review scrutiny, consolidated review+CI analysis, self-poll prevention, verified-facts guideline for triage, and explicit issue-closing in nightly cleaner. ([#1172](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1172), [#1181](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1181), [#1199](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1199), [#1204](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1204), [#1212](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1212), [#1198](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1198), [#1209](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1209))

## 0.27.0

### Improved

- **`wt step promote` command (experimental)**: Exchange branches between the main worktree and any linked worktree, including swapping gitignored files (build artifacts, `.env`, `node_modules/`). Shows mismatch state in `wt list` with ⚑ indicator; restore with no arguments from main worktree. [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/step/) ([#789](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/789), thanks @zpeleg for the feature request in [#738](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/738))

- **Instant worktree removal**: `wt remove` now renames the worktree to a staging path before spawning the background cleanup, making the path unavailable immediately instead of after a 1-second sleep. Falls back to legacy removal if rename fails (cross-filesystem, permissions). ([#773](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/773))

- **Graceful recovery from deleted worktree directory**: When a worktree is removed while a shell is still in that directory, `wt switch` and `wt list` now recover automatically — find the parent repository from `$PWD` and proceed without pre-switch hooks. ([#1146](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1146), thanks @davidbeesley for reporting [#1109](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1109))

- **PR/MR support promoted out of experimental**: GitHub PR (`pr:<number>`) and GitLab MR (`mr:<number>`) targets in `wt switch` are now considered stable — 11 minor releases with no interface changes since v0.15.0. ([#1114](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1114))

### Fixed

- **SSH URLs with ports**: Remote matching now handles `ssh://git@host:2222/owner/repo.git` — ports are stripped during URL parsing instead of rejecting the URL. ([#1151](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1151))

- **Config path resolution**: `wt config create` now resolves the same path as config loading, fixing a mismatch when using XDG directories. ([#1135](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1135), thanks @christopher-buss for reporting [#1134](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1134))

- **PTY prompt echo interleaving**: Approval prompts no longer intermix with echoed input on slower systems. Uses quiescence detection instead of a fixed sleep. ([#1133](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1133))

- **Better diagnostics when foreground removal fails**: When `wt remove --foreground` fails with "Directory not empty", now shows the remaining top-level entries (capped at 10) and suggests trying background removal. ([#1150](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1150))

- **Output formatting consistency**: Hints use canonical "To X, run Y" phrasing, config update hints render in gutter blocks with correct `-C` flag for linked worktrees, and ANSI color nesting fixed in hint messages. ([#1138](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1138), [#1137](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1137))

- **Panic-safe error propagation**: Replaced `.unwrap()` and `.expect()` calls in functions returning `Result` with proper `?` and `bail!` error propagation. ([#1127](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1127))

### Documentation

- **Bot trigger renamed**: CI bot responds to `@worktrunk-bot` instead of `@claude`, matching the actual GitHub username. ([#1149](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1149))

- **`wt step promote` documented in worktree model**: The branch-exchange operation is noted as the sole exception to the "never retarget a worktree" rule. ([#1154](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1154))

### Internal

- **CI security model**: Rulesets, token consolidation, and environment protection hardened for GitHub Actions workflows. ([#1118](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1118))

- **Nightly CI workflows**: Automated review of Claude CI session logs and 24-hour code quality sweep for bugs, missing tests, and stale docs. ([#1111](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1111))

- **CI reviewer and bot improvements**: Better failure tracing, Dependabot PR reviews, thread resolution ordering, LGTM dedup, actionable feedback, automatic response to bot PR comments, and graceful handling of mentions on merged/closed PRs. ([#1117](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1117), [#1128](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1128), [#1129](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1129), [#1131](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1131), [#1141](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1141), [#1142](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1142), [#1145](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1145), [#1147](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1147), [#1153](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1153), [#1158](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1158), [#1164](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1164))

## 0.26.1

### Fixed

- **Statusline panic without LLM config**: `wt list statusline` panicked when no LLM command was configured. Now skips summary generation gracefully. ([#1107](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1107))

### Internal

- Demo GIFs now show the Summary column in `wt list --full` output. ([#1104](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1104), [#1106](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1106))
- CI session log uploads fixed to use correct path. ([#1103](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1103))

## 0.26.0

### Improved

- **Summary column in `wt list --full`**: LLM-generated one-line branch descriptions. Opt-in via `[list] summary = true` in config (experimental). Requires `[commit.generation]` config. ([#1100](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1100))

- **`wt step diff` command**: Show all uncommitted and untracked changes that `wt merge` would include as a unified diff against the merge base. Pass `-- --stat` for a summary. [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/step/) Closes [#1043](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1043). ([#1074](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1074), thanks @davidbeesley for the feature discussion)

- **`pre-switch` hook**: New hook that runs before `wt switch` validation. Use it to fetch-if-stale or run pre-flight checks before switching. Respects `--no-verify`. [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/) ([#1094](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1094), thanks @jdb8 for the use case in [#1085](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1085))

- **`wt config update` command**: Automatically apply config migrations — detects deprecated patterns (template variables, `[commit-generation]`, `approved-commands`), shows a diff preview, and applies with confirmation. Use `--yes` to skip the prompt. ([#1083](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1083))

- **Configurable picker timeout**: New `[switch.picker] timeout-ms` setting (default: 200ms, `0` to disable). The `[select]` config section is deprecated in favor of `[switch.picker]` — run `wt config update` to migrate. ([#1087](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1087))

- **Command audit log**: All hook executions and LLM commands are logged to `.git/wt-logs/commands.jsonl` with timestamps, exit codes, and duration. Auto-rotates at 1MB. View with `wt config state logs get` or query with `jq`. ([#1088](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1088))

### Fixed

- **Hook CWD wrong from subdirectories**: Hooks invoked from a subdirectory within a worktree ran with incorrect CWD and `{{ worktree_path }}`/`{{ worktree_name }}` template variables resolved incorrectly. ([#1097](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1097))

- **`copy-ignored` verbose output and error handling**: `-v` flag was silently ignored, error messages lacked file paths, and broken symlinks from interrupted copies caused failures. Also skips non-regular files (sockets, FIFOs) instead of failing. Fixes [#1084](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1084). ([#1090](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1090), thanks @jdb8 for reporting)

- **Nushell `wt list` piping**: `wt list --format json | from json` failed in nushell because the wrapper's stdout capture prevented piping. Fixes [#1062](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1062). ([#1081](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1081), thanks @omerxx for reporting)

- **Approved-commands lost during config migration**: Running the config migration could silently discard existing approval data. Now copies `approved-commands` entries to `approvals.toml` before migration. ([#1079](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1079))

- **Deprecation messages reference `wt config update`**: Deprecation warnings now point to the new `wt config update` command for one-step migration instead of manual `mv` instructions. ([#1089](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1089))

### Documentation

- **`wt switch` help text**: Updated description to "Switch to a worktree; create if needed" to surface auto-create behavior. ([#1082](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1082))

- **Docs syntax highlighting**: Migrated to giallo engine with a warm theme. ([#1080](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1080))

### Internal

- **CI reviewer improvements**: File-based GraphQL queries, centralized shell quoting guidance, artifact upload path fixes. ([#1091](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1091), [#1098](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1098), [#1099](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1099))

- **Issue triage for external contributors**: CI triage workflow now runs for all external contributor issues. ([#1086](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1086))

## 0.25.0

### Improved

- **System-wide config file**: Load organization-wide defaults from a system config file (`/etc/xdg/worktrunk/config.toml` on Linux, `/Library/Application Support/worktrunk/config.toml` on macOS) before user config. Override the path with `$WORKTRUNK_SYSTEM_CONFIG_PATH`. Visible in `wt config show`. ([#963](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/963), thanks @goodtune)

- **AI summary preview in `wt switch`**: New 5th tab shows AI-generated branch summaries using your configured `[commit.generation]` LLM command. Opt-in via `[list] summary = true` in config. Summaries are cached in `.git/wt-cache/summaries/` with hash-based invalidation. [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/llm-commits/) ([#1049](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1049))

- **Approvals stored in dedicated file**: Approved commands moved from `config.toml` to `approvals.toml`, enabling dotfile management of config without exposing machine-local trust state. Existing approvals in `config.toml` are read automatically with a deprecation warning and migration instructions in `wt config show`. ([#1042](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1042))

- **Error hints include `--execute` context**: When `wt switch --execute=<cmd>` fails, suggested commands now include the full `--execute` and trailing args so you can copy-paste the fix directly. ([#1064](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1064))

- **`wt list` startup performance**: Config resolution moved into the parallel phase, running concurrently with other git commands instead of sequentially on the critical path. ([#1054](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1054))

### Fixed

- **Submodule worktree path resolution**: `wt switch` resolved to `.git/modules/` instead of the working directory inside git submodules. Fixes [#1069](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1069). ([#1070](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1070), thanks @SokiKawashima for reporting)

- **Per-project `[list] timeout` ignored**: The timeout setting from per-project config (`[projects."name".list]`) was not applied — only the global config value was used. ([#1063](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1063))

- **Empty repos crash `wt list`**: Repositories with no commits (unborn HEAD) caused errors. Now renders empty cells for commit-dependent fields. ([#1058](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1058))

- **Stray blank lines before hints in error output**: Error messages with hints (↳) had an extra blank line separating the hint from its subject. ([#1072](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1072))

### Internal

- **Shell escaping consolidation**: Dropped `shlex` crate, consolidated on `shell_escape` across the codebase. ([#1065](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1065))

- **CI reviewer improvements**: Resolve review threads, skip trivial re-approvals, default to suggestions. ([#1068](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1068))

## 0.24.1

### Improved

- **Template error messages**: Template expansion errors now show what failed, the failing template line, and available variables for undefined variable errors. ([#1041](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1041))

- **Interactive picker preview speed**: Preview pre-computation is parallelized via rayon, reducing the chance of a blocking cache miss when switching preview tabs. ([#1048](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1048))

- **`wt switch` performance**: Switching to existing worktrees defers path computation, reducing startup latency. ([#1029](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1029), [#1030](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1030), [#1031](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1031))

### Fixed

- **PowerShell wrapper swallows `-D` flag**: The wrapper's `[Parameter(ValueFromRemainingArguments)]` promoted it to an "advanced function", causing PowerShell to consume `-D` as `-Debug` instead of passing it to `wt.exe`. Fixes [#885](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/885). ([#1057](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1057), thanks @DiTo97 for reporting)

- **Nushell shell integration**: Multiple fixes for nushell — auto-detect for install even without vendor/autoload directory ([#1032](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1032)), detection checks multiple config paths ([#1038](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1038)), uninstall cleans all candidate locations ([#1050](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1050)), wrapper hardening and improved diagnostics ([#1059](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1059)). (thanks @arnaudlimbourg for [#1032](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1032), [#1038](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1038), and @omerxx for reporting in [#964](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/964))

- **Interactive picker leaves screen artifacts**: The picker left visual artifacts after exiting. Fixes [#1027](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1027). ([#1028](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1028), [#1044](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1044), thanks @davidbeesley)

- **Statusline counts files outside sparse checkout cone**: Branch diff statistics in the statusline included files outside the sparse checkout cone, inflating counts. ([#1024](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1024), thanks @bendrucker)

- **Template placeholders leak into displayed commands**: `{{ }}` delimiters in hook commands were incorrectly syntax-highlighted, showing ANSI artifacts instead of the template text. ([#1022](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1022))

- **Hook announcement trailing colon**: Hook announcements like "Running post-merge project:sync:" had a trailing colon that created visual noise. ([#1025](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1025))

- **Blank line after approval prompts**: Approval prompts showed an extra blank line after the user pressed Enter. ([#1040](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1040))

### Internal

- **Automated Claude PR review**: Added workflow for automated code review on PRs. ([#1037](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1037))

- **Time-to-first-output benchmarks**: Added benchmarks for `remove`, `switch`, and `list` startup latency. ([#1023](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1023))

## 0.24.0

### Improved

- **Nushell support (experimental)**: Initial nushell shell integration — shell wrapper, completions, and `wt config shell install` support. This is a proof-of-concept and will need iteration before it's usable; if you're a nushell user feel free to try it and report issues. ([#964](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/964), thanks @arnaudlimbourg)

- **Version check in `wt config show --full`**: The diagnostics section now queries GitHub for the latest release and shows "Up to date", "Update available", or "Version check unavailable". Gated behind `--full` so normal commands are unaffected. Closes [#1003](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1003). ([#1011](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1011), thanks @risperdal for requesting)

- **Fish outdated wrapper detection**: `wt config show` now detects when the installed fish shell wrapper has outdated code (e.g., from a previous version) and shows "Outdated shell extension" with a reinstall hint, instead of incorrectly reporting "Not configured". ([#1009](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1009))

### Fixed

- **LLM subprocess blocked in Claude Code sessions**: Claude Code sets `CLAUDECODE=1` which blocks nested invocations, breaking `wt step commit` and `wt merge` commit generation. Now strips the env var before spawning the LLM command. ([#1021](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1021))

- **Blank line between hint and subject in config show**: The "To configure, run wt config shell install" hint was visually detached from the shell entries it referred to. ([#1007](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1007))

### Documentation

- **Status symbol descriptions**: Corrected quick start documentation — `↕` means diverged from default branch (not unpushed commits), `+` means staged changes (not uncommitted changes). ([#1017](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1017))

- **Claude Code commit command**: Added `CLAUDECODE` env var unsetting to the Claude Code documentation for commit message generation. ([#1020](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1020))

### Internal

- **Environment variable prefix standardization**: Renamed remaining `WT_TEST_*` env vars to `WORKTRUNK_TEST_*`, completing the prefix migration. ([#1016](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1016))

- **Plugin metadata**: Aligned plugin description with Cargo.toml tagline ([#1019](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1019)), fixed duplicate skills declaration ([#1014](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1014), thanks @jacksonblankenship for reporting [#1013](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1013)), corrected marketplace source path ([#1012](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1012)).

## 0.23.3

### Improved

- **Error display for failed commands**: Failed git commands are now shown in a separate bash-highlighted gutter block instead of inline parenthesized text, making long commands much more readable. ([#1001](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1001))

- **PowerShell detection and diagnostics**: Detect PowerShell via `PSModulePath` environment variable so Windows users get "shell requires restart" instead of "not installed". `wt config show` now displays the detected shell and verification hints. Fixes [#885](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/885). ([#987](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/987), thanks @DiTo97 for reporting)

### Fixed

- **Fish shell wrapper incompatible with fish < 3.1**: The shell wrapper used `VAR=value command` syntax which requires fish 3.1+. Now uses `env VAR=value ...` for compatibility with all fish versions. Fixes [#999](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/999). ([#1000](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1000), thanks @chrisrickard for reporting)

- **Symlink paths resolved in display messages**: Status messages like "Created worktree @ path" showed canonical paths instead of the user's symlink path. Now consistent with cd directives. Fixes [#968](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/968). ([#985](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/985), thanks @brooke-hamilton for reporting)

### Documentation

- **Deduplicated manual shell setup**: Removed duplicated per-shell eval snippets from `wt config --help`, referencing `wt config shell init --help` instead. ([#986](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/986))

- **PowerShell diagnostic guidance**: Added PowerShell-specific debugging steps to shell integration and troubleshooting references. ([#993](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/993))

## 0.23.2

### Improved

- **`--force` flag for `wt step copy-ignored`**: Overwrite existing destination files when copying gitignored files to new worktrees. Closes [#971](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/971). ([#974](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/974), thanks @williamgoulois for requesting)

### Fixed

- **`wt switch pr:NNNN` / `mr:NNNN` fails in repos without fetch refspecs**: Same-repo PRs and MRs failed with "No branch named X" in single-branch clones or bare repos because fetch didn't create remote tracking branches, and worktree creation relied on DWIM. Now uses explicit refspecs and `-b` fallback. ([#965](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/965), thanks @andoniaf)

- **Progressive table garbled when output exceeds terminal height**: `wt list` output was corrupted when more lines than the terminal height, because cursor-up commands tried to reach scrolled-off lines. Now detects overflow and falls back to a clean full-table print. ([#981](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/981))

- **Symlink paths resolved to canonical in cd directives**: When navigating via symlinks, cd directives wrote canonical paths, silently moving users out of their symlink tree. Now preserves the user's logical path. Fixes [#968](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/968). ([#976](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/976), thanks @brooke-hamilton for reporting)

- **Terminal artifacts when cancelling interactive picker**: Pressing Esc to cancel the picker left terminal artifacts and a misplaced cursor. Now skim handles cleanup symmetrically for both cancel and accept. ([#984](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/984))

### Documentation

- **Hook examples: safer port cleanup**: Added `-sTCP:LISTEN` to `lsof` in hook examples to prevent accidentally killing unrelated processes with connections to the port. ([#952](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/952), thanks @andoniaf)

## 0.23.1

### Improved

- **Interactive picker runs hooks**: `wt switch` without arguments (the interactive picker) now runs post-switch, post-start, and post-create hooks, matching the non-interactive path. ([#942](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/942))

- **Combined hook output during removal**: Post-remove and post-switch hooks during worktree removal are now shown on a single output line instead of two separate lines. ([#943](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/943))

### Fixed

- **Shell escape corruption with template filters**: Shell escaping was applied before template rendering, so filters like `sanitize` operated on already-escaped strings, corrupting values with special characters (e.g., apostrophes in branch names). ([#944](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/944))

- **`wt switch -` history corruption**: `wt switch foo` while already in `foo` would incorrectly record `foo` as the previous branch, breaking `wt switch -` ping-pong. ([#944](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/944))

- **`--base` without `--create` showed wrong error**: Using `--base` without `--create` could produce misleading errors (e.g., "No previous branch") instead of the expected warning that `--base` requires `--create`. ([#944](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/944))

## 0.23.0

### Improved

- **Preserve subdirectory position when switching**: `wt switch` now lands in the same subdirectory of the target worktree if it exists, falling back to the root if it doesn't. [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/switch/) ([#939](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/939), thanks @frederik-suerig for requesting)

- **`wt switch --no-cd`**: Skip the directory change after switching, useful for scripting or running commands in another worktree without leaving your current shell position. [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/switch/) ([#932](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/932), thanks @ArnaudRinquin for requesting)

- **`Alt-c` to create worktree from picker**: In the interactive picker, press `Alt-c` to create a new worktree using the current query as the branch name. ([#933](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/933))

- **Faster preview tab switching**: Preview tabs (HEAD±, log, main…±, remote⇅) are now pre-computed in a background thread, making tab switching near-instant. ([#935](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/935))

### Fixed

- **Pager width detection**: Makes preview pane width available to pagers via `$COLUMNS`, so tools like delta can use it for correct side-by-side rendering (e.g., `pager = "delta --width=$COLUMNS"`). Fixes [#924](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/924). (thanks @tnlanh for reporting) ([#930](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/930))

- **ANSI style bleeding in preview tabs**: Fixed styling artifacts where dividers appeared emphasized and diffstat lines appeared dim. ([#931](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/931))

- **URL template expansion with `--skip`**: Skip URL template expansion when `--skip url-status` is used, avoiding unnecessary work. ([#923](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/923))

- **Hook error consistency**: `wt hook <type>` now errors consistently for all hook types when no hooks are configured, instead of silently succeeding for some types. ([#916](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/916))

### Documentation

- Improved install instructions in release notes. ([#918](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/918))

### Internal

- CI: check for existing fix PRs before creating duplicates. ([#922](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/922))

## 0.22.0

### Improved

- **`wt switch` integrates interactive picker**: `wt switch` without arguments now opens the interactive picker (previously `wt select`). The separate `wt select` command is deprecated with a warning directing users to use `wt switch` instead. Closes [#890](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/890). (thanks @strangemonad for the suggestion) ([#894](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/894))

- **TOML syntax highlighting**: Config output from `wt config show` and `wt config shell show-theme` now renders TOML with syntax highlighting (table headers cyan, string values green, comments dimmed). ([#905](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/905))

- **Bash syntax highlighting improvements**: Multi-line bash commands in hook previews now preserve syntax highlighting across newlines. Wrapped continuation lines are indented with 3 extra spaces to distinguish terminal-forced wraps from actual newlines. ([#906](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/906))

- **Unified background hook output**: Contiguous post-switch and post-start hooks are now combined into a single output line instead of two separate lines. ([#908](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/908))

### Documentation

- Removed redundant horizontal rules before H1 headers in documentation pages. ([#909](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/909))

### Internal

- Updated GitHub Actions and Rust nightly versions. ([#910](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/910))
- Bumped tree-sitter ecosystem to 0.26 for unified multi-line highlighting. ([#906](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/906))
- Dependency updates: minijinja 2.15.1, clap, indexmap, ignore, thiserror, time, and others. ([#912](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/912), [#913](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/913))

## 0.21.0

### Improved

- **Absolute paths in `worktree-path` templates**: New `{{ repo_path }}` variable enables absolute path configurations like `{{ repo_path }}/../{{ repo }}.{{ branch | sanitize }}`. Tilde expansion is also supported (`~/worktrees/{{ repo }}/{{ branch }}`). Fixes [#902](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/902). (thanks @bingryan for reporting) ([#904](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/904))

### Documentation

- Documented prefix stripping in `worktree-path` templates using minijinja's built-in `replace` filter and slicing syntax. Closes [#900](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/900). (thanks @laurentkempe for requesting) ([#903](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/903))

## 0.20.3

### Fixed

- **PowerShell auto-configuration on Windows**: When running `wt config shell install` from cmd.exe or PowerShell, both PowerShell profile files are now created automatically (Documents/PowerShell and Documents/WindowsPowerShell). Fixes [#885](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/885). (thanks @DiTo97 for reporting) ([#898](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/898))

- **`-C` flag respected in hook context**: The `-C` flag now correctly sets the worktree path for hooks, fixing `wt -C /path hook ...` commands that were using the wrong context. ([#899](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/899))

- **`--config` path validation**: Now warns when `--config` points to a non-existent file instead of silently using defaults. ([#895](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/895))

### Documentation

- Fix shell quoting in hook examples — template variables are auto-escaped, so manual quoting caused issues with special characters. ([#895](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/895))

- Updated documentation to use tool-agnostic terminology for LLM commit messages. ([#891](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/891))

### Internal

- Consolidated PR/MR resolution into unified `remote_ref` module. ([#893](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/893))

- Simplified command structure and removed dead code. ([#892](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/892))

- Eliminated Settings types, added accessor methods to Config types. ([#896](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/896))

## 0.20.2

### Fixed

- **PowerShell shell integration**: Fixed shell integration not working on Windows PowerShell. The init script now includes `| Out-String` to convert array output to a string. Existing configs without this fix are detected as "not installed" so `wt config shell install` will update them automatically. Fixes [#885](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/885). (thanks @DiTo97 for reporting) ([#888](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/888))

- **Branch removal message**: "No worktree found for branch X" now shows as info (○) instead of warning (▲) when removing a branch-only, since this is expected behavior. ([#887](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/887))

### Documentation

- Documented main worktree behavior in `wt step relocate --help`. ([#889](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/889))

## 0.20.1

### Improved

- **`wt statusline --format=json`**: Output current worktree as JSON (same structure as `wt list --format=json`). Also adds `--format=claude-code` as canonical syntax (the old `--claude-code` flag remains supported). Fixes nested worktree detection that incorrectly identified parent worktrees. ([#875](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/875))

- **`wt config show` shell status**: Each shell integration line now starts with the shell name (e.g., "bash: Already configured...") for easier scanning. ([#881](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/881))

- **`wt config show` performance**: 8x faster (~1.2s → ~150ms) by using PATH lookup instead of running `claude --version`. ([#883](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/883))

### Fixed

- **Config TOML formatting**: Fixed spurious empty `[commit]` header appearing when only `[commit.generation]` is configured. ([#879](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/879))

- **Documentation URLs**: Fixed broken worktrunk.dev URLs in fish wrapper and config templates. ([#882](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/882))

### Documentation

- Fixed `worktree-path` example on tips page. ([#876](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/876), thanks @uriahcarpenter)

- Fixed OSC 8 hyperlink sequences leaking through to web docs as garbage text. ([#870](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/870))

### Internal

- Demo snapshot mode for regression testing of command output. ([#871](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/871))

- CI improvements: nextest binary compatibility fix, pinned runner versions, weekly renovation workflow. ([#878](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/878), [#884](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/884))

## 0.20.0

### Improved

- **`wt step relocate` command**: Move worktrees to their expected paths based on the `worktree-path` template. Supports `--dry-run` preview, filtering by branch name, and `--commit` to auto-commit dirty worktrees before moving. Handles complex scenarios including worktree swaps (A→B, B→A), chains, and the `--clobber` flag to back up blocking non-worktree paths. [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/step/) ([#790](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/790))

- **LLM setup prompt**: First-time interactive prompt when users attempt `wt merge`, `wt step commit`, or `wt step squash` without LLM configuration. Detects available tools (claude, codex) and offers auto-configuration with `?` to preview the generated config. Add `skip-commit-generation-prompt` to user config to suppress. ([#867](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/867))

- **Consistent prompt styling**: Interactive prompts now use consistent cyan styling via `prompt_message()` formatting. ([#858](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/858))

### Fixed

- **Path display in error messages**: User-facing paths now consistently use `format_path_for_display()`, fixing cases where raw `.display()` output could show inconsistent path formats. ([#856](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/856))

### Documentation

- Added Quick Start section to front page showing the switch → list → merge workflow. ([#864](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/864))
- Updated template documentation: removed deprecated `template-file` options, added `{{ git_diff_stat }}` variable, clarified squash-only variables. ([#854](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/854))
- Fixed stale documentation for `[commit.generation]` config format, statusline context gauge, and CI status for remote-only branches. ([#853](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/853))

### Internal

- Bumped nix crate from 0.30.1 to 0.31.1. ([#860](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/860))
- Refactored deprecation detection for better modularity. ([#852](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/852))

## 0.19.0

### Improved

- **LLM commit configuration redesign**: The `[commit-generation]` section is now `[commit.generation]`, and `command` + `args` are unified into a single shell-executed `command` string. Existing configs continue to work — a deprecation warning shows the new format and creates a `.new` config file you can apply with `mv`. Claude Code (`claude -p`) and Codex (`codex exec`) are documented as first-class options alongside `llm`. See the [LLM commits guide](https://worktrunk.dev/llm-commits/). ([#809](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/809), [#837](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/837))

- **Per-project hooks**: User config can define hooks per-project that append to global hooks. Execution order: global → per-project → project config. Configure under `[projects."owner/repo".hooks]`. ([#842](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/842))

- **Context window gauge for Claude Code**: Statusline mode shows a moon phase gauge (🌕🌔🌓🌒🌑) for context window usage. ([#840](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/840))

- **CI status for remote-only branches**: `wt list --remotes` shows CI status for branches that only exist on the remote. ([#817](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/817))

- **Hook log file lookup**: `wt config state logs get --hook=<spec>` returns the path to a specific hook's log file. ([#816](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/816), thanks @EduardoSimon for requesting)

- **Branch/fork info in PR/MR display**: `wt switch pr:N` shows the source branch (e.g., `feature-auth`) or fork reference (e.g., `contributor:feature`) alongside PR details. ([#808](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/808))

- **Claude Code section in `wt config show`**: Shows Claude CLI installation status, plugin status, and statusline configuration. ([#833](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/833))

- **Deprecation details moved to `wt config show`**: Other commands show a brief pointer instead of full deprecation details. ([#828](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/828))

- **Config validation suggests correct file**: When a config key belongs in user config but appears in project config (or vice versa), the warning suggests the correct location. ([#804](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/804))

- **Tilde paths in hints**: Shell command hints use `~` instead of full home directory paths when safe. ([#710](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/710))

- **Improved `--create` conflict error**: `wt switch --create pr:101` shows the existing branch name in the error. ([#807](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/807))

- **CI status prioritized in statusline**: CI status is retained longer when the statusline truncates. ([#845](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/845))

### Fixed

- **Template expansion bugs**: Fixed `worktree_path_of_branch` not respecting shell_escape flag, Windows CI cache rename failures, and `WORKTRUNK_MAX_CONCURRENT_COMMANDS=0` meaning "no limit". ([#847](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/847), [#849](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/849))

- **Hook and CI status panics**: Fixed panic when serializing mixed named/unnamed hook configs, banned colons in hook names to prevent parsing ambiguity, and fixed GitLab MR detection when multiple MRs exist without project ID. ([#846](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/846), [#848](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/848))

- **Pre-commit hooks for clean worktree squash**: Pre-commit hooks are collected for approval when squashing on a clean worktree. Previously only collected when dirty. ([#695](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/695))

- **Hint message formatting**: Fixed ANSI escape code interference in dim hint messages. ([#836](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/836))

- **Spurious [commit] header**: Fixed config migration showing `[commit]` section header when only `commit-generation` fields needed migration. ([#834](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/834))

### Documentation

- Added at-a-glance examples to config documentation. ([#826](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/826))
- Clarified user project-specific settings section. ([#835](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/835))
- Consistent worktree terminology throughout docs. ([#813](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/813))
- Added tip for monitoring hook logs. ([#838](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/838))

### Internal

- Replaced manual quote escaping with `shell_escape` crate. ([#810](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/810))
- Used `sanitize-filename` crate for filename sanitization. ([#832](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/832))
- Cached CI tool availability checks. ([#831](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/831))
- Moved inline imports to module top level. ([#818](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/818), [#819](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/819), [#820](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/820), [#822](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/822))

## 0.18.2

### Improved

- **PR/MR context display**: `wt switch pr:N` and `mr:N` now show PR/MR details (title, author, state, URL) after fetching. ([#782](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/782))

- **Fork PR branch conflicts**: When a fork PR's branch name conflicts with an existing local branch (e.g., contributor opens PR from their `main`), worktrunk now creates a prefixed branch like `contributor/main` instead of failing. Closes [#714](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/714). (thanks @vimtor for reporting)

### Fixed

- **Help output formatting**: Fixed double blank lines appearing after demo comments in help output. ([#795](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/795))

- **Error handling reliability**: Replaced fragile string-based error parsing with structured approaches for git stash, GitHub CLI, and GitLab CLI operations. ([#787](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/787))

### Documentation

- **ci-status help text**: Improved clarity of the ci-status configuration documentation. ([#794](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/794))

- **wt remove help text**: Simplified short description and added documentation for `pre-remove` and `post-remove` hooks. ([#792](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/792))

- **Subcommand documentation**: Fixed generated website docs for subcommands (like `wt step copy-ignored`, `wt config state`) to include their short descriptions. ([#793](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/793))

## 0.18.1

### Fixed

- **Submodule worktree paths**: Worktrees are now created in the correct location when running inside a git submodule. Previously, worktrees were created relative to the parent repo's `.git/modules/` directory instead of the submodule's working directory. ([#762](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/762), thanks @lajarre; [#777](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/777), thanks @mhonsel for reporting)
- **Shell integration warnings**: Warnings about shell integration now check if the *current* shell has integration configured, not whether *any* shell does. This fixes misleading "shell requires restart" messages when e.g. bash had integration but the user was running fish. ([#772](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/772))
- **"Not found" error messages**: Improved error message phrasing — "No branch named X" instead of "Branch X not found", "Branch X has no worktree" instead of "No worktree found for branch X". Context-appropriate hints now appear (e.g., `wt remove` no longer suggests `--create`). ([#774](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/774))

### Internal

- Unified PR/MR reference resolution, reducing code duplication. ([#778](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/778))

## 0.18.0

### Improved

- **Post-remove hook**: New hook type runs after worktree removal. Template variables (`{{ branch }}`, `{{ worktree_path }}`, `{{ commit }}`) reference the removed worktree, enabling cleanup scripts for containers, servers, or other resources. ([#757](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/757))
- **Graceful handling of missing worktree directories**: `wt remove` now prunes stale git metadata when the worktree directory was deleted externally (e.g., `rm -rf`), making the command more idempotent. Fixes [#724](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/724). (thanks @strangemonad for reporting)
- **Config validation warnings at load time**: Unknown fields in config files (typos like `[commit-gen]` instead of `[commit-generation]`) now show warnings immediately instead of only in `wt config show`. ([#758](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/758))

### Fixed

- **Age column shows "future" on NixOS/direnv**: `wt list` no longer uses `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` for time calculations, which NixOS and direnv commonly set to past timestamps for reproducible builds. Fixes [#763](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/763). (thanks @ngotchac for reporting)
- **CI status with URL-based pushremote**: CI detection now works when `branch.<name>.pushremote` is set to a URL directly (as `gh pr checkout` does) instead of a remote name. ([#769](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/769))
- **GitLab nested groups in URL parsing**: URLs like `gitlab.com/group/subgroup/repo` now correctly identify `repo` as the repository name instead of `subgroup`. This was a security fix — previously, approval bypass was possible across sibling repos in the same parent group. ([#768](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/768))
- **GitLab CI status detection**: Fixed multiple issues with `glab` CLI compatibility — MR lookup now uses two-step resolution, "manual" pipelines show as running instead of failed, and rate limit errors are handled properly. Fixes [#764](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/764). (thanks @ngotchac for reporting)

### Internal

- Refactored accessor functions to use bare nouns per Rust convention. ([#765](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/765))
- Clarified target/integration naming across codebase. ([#755](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/755))

## 0.17.0

### Improved

- **Per-project config overrides** (Experimental): Override settings per-project in user config. Supports `worktree-path`, `commit-generation`, `list`, `commit`, and `merge` sections. Config precedence: CLI arg > project config > global config > default. Closes [#596](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/596). ([#749](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/749))
- **Search all remotes for branch existence**: Branch existence checks and completions now search all remotes instead of just the primary remote, matching git's behavior. When a branch exists on multiple remotes, completions show all of them (e.g., `feature ⇣ 2d origin, upstream`). ([#744](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/744))
- **CI detection for fork workflows**: CI status detection now searches all remotes and uses `gh config get git_protocol` / `glab config get git_protocol` for fork URL protocol preference instead of inferring from existing remotes. ([#753](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/753))

### Fixed

- **Same-repo PR switching with stale refs**: `wt switch pr:N` for same-repo PRs now fetches the branch before validation, fixing "Branch not found" errors when local refs were stale. ([#742](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/742))
- **Project identifier collision for repos without remotes**: Repos without remotes now use their full canonical path as the project identifier instead of just the directory name, preventing approval collisions between unrelated repos (e.g., `~/work/myproject` vs `~/personal/myproject`). Users with remoteless repos will need to re-approve commands. ([#747](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/747))

### Internal

- Cross-platform path handling improvements using `path-slash` crate and `Path::file_name()`. ([#750](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/750))
- Renamed `WorktrunkConfig` to `UserConfig` internally. ([#746](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/746))

## 0.16.0

### Improved

- **Background hook verbosity**: Background hooks (post-start, post-switch) now show a single-line summary by default instead of per-hook output. Use `-v` to see detailed output with expanded commands. We're open to feedback on this change — let us know in [#690](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/690). (thanks @clutchski for reporting)

### Internal

- Fixed dead Apple documentation link in copy-ignored rationale. ([#743](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/743))

## 0.15.5

### Fixed

- **Hook execution order**: Hooks now run in the order defined in the config file. Previously, HashMap iteration randomized the order. Fixes [#737](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/737). (thanks @ngotchac for reporting)

## 0.15.4

### Improved

- **Git progress for slow worktree creation**: When `git worktree add` takes more than 400ms (common on large repos), worktrunk now shows a progress message and streams git's output instead of going silent. ([#725](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/725))
- **Verbose template expansion output**: `-v` now shows template expansion details: the template, expanded command, and any undefined variables with SemiStrict fallback behavior. ([#712](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/712))
- **Shell integration hint for explicit path invocation**: When running wt via explicit path (e.g., `./target/debug/wt`) with shell integration configured, the warning now suggests running `wt switch <branch>` to use the shell-wrapped command. ([#721](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/721))

### Fixed

- **Unsafe upstream when creating branch from remote base**: `wt switch --create feature --base=origin/main` no longer sets up tracking to origin/main, preventing accidental pushes to the base branch. Fixes [#713](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/713). (thanks @kfirba)
- **Credential redaction in debug logs**: URLs with embedded credentials (e.g., `https://token@github.com/...`) are now redacted in `-vv` debug output. ([#718](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/718))
- **Hook preview shows template on expansion failure**: `wt hook show --expanded` now displays both the error message and original template when expansion fails, instead of hiding the template. ([#722](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/722))

### Documentation

- **Homebrew install uses core tap**: Install command updated from `max-sixty/worktrunk/wt` to `worktrunk`. ([#716](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/716), thanks @chenrui333)
- **Hook docs reordered**: post-start (background) is now the recommended default, with post-create for blocking dependencies. ([#733](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/733))

### Internal

- Simplified GitHub/GitLab CI status detection. ([#730](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/730))
- Previous worktree gutter changed from `-` to `+` for visual consistency. ([#699](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/699))

## 0.15.3

### Fixed

- **`--execute` command display**: Shows the expanded command in a gutter with path context instead of showing the raw template before expansion. ([#708](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/708))
- **CRLF line endings in error display**: Multiline errors with Windows (`\r\n`) or old Mac (`\r`) line endings now display correctly instead of falling through to single-line handling. ([#707](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/707))

### Documentation

- **Arch Linux install via AUR**: Added installation instructions and shell integration command. ([#709](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/709), [#561](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/561), thanks @razor-x)

## 0.15.2

### Improved

- **`wt config shell completions <shell>`**: Generate static shell completion scripts for package managers and custom installation. ([#701](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/701), thanks @chenrui333)
- **Debug logging threshold**: Now requires `-vv` instead of `-v` for debug logging and diagnostic file generation, freeing `-v` for future use. ([#702](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/702))

### Fixed

- **Fork PR fetching**: `wt switch pr:N` now works when `origin` points to a fork by fetching PR refs from the upstream remote. Shows actionable error with `git remote add` command if upstream remote is missing. ([#704](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/704))
- **Fork PR branch naming**: Fork PR branches now use the original branch name (e.g., `feature-fix`) instead of `owner/feature-fix`, so `git push` works correctly. ([#706](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/706))
- **Config race conditions**: File locking prevents corruption when multiple `wt` processes modify config simultaneously. ([#693](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/693))
- **Nested worktree detection**: Current worktree indicator (`@`) now shows on the correct worktree when worktrees are nested (e.g., `.worktrees/` layout inside repo). ([#697](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/697))
- **Symlink path resolution**: Worktree commands work correctly on systems with symlinks (e.g., macOS `/var` → `/private/var`). ([#696](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/696))
- **Pre-remove hook failures**: Shell no longer cd's to main worktree when pre-remove hooks fail, leaving user in their current location. ([#692](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/692))
- **PowerShell completion robustness**: Completion registration errors no longer break the shell wrapper function. ([#674](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/674))

### Documentation

- Added missing `orphan` (`∅`) symbol and `no_worktree` state to JSON output documentation. ([#687](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/687))
- Clarified Unicode handling in shell detection. ([#700](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/700))

### Internal

- Refactored large files into focused modules. ([#688](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/688))
- Consolidated integration reason computation into Repository method. ([#689](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/689))
- Added verbose level tracking infrastructure for future `-v` output. ([#703](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/703))
- PowerShell template uses `WORKTRUNK_BIN` for test isolation. ([#674](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/674))

## 0.15.1

### Improved

- **`wt config show` diagnostics**: When shell integration is not active, now shows how the command was invoked, the binary path (if different), and `$SHELL` environment variable. Helps diagnose setup issues. ([#683](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/683))
- **Help pager follows git convention**: `-h` never opens a pager, `--help` uses pager when available. Closes [#583](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/583). ([#651](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/651), thanks @razor-x)
- **Verbose mode logging**: `-v` now logs command stdout/stderr and all spawned processes including background hooks, `wt for-each` commands, and shell probes. ([#680](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/680))

### Documentation

- **FAQ reordered**: Questions now ordered by frequency and importance.

### Internal

- **AUR package**: Worktrunk now published to Arch Linux AUR on each release. ([#585](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/585), thanks @razor-x)
- **Codecov Test Analytics**: Integration tests now report to Codecov Test Analytics. ([#682](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/682))

## 0.15.0

### Improved

- **`wt switch pr:<number>` syntax** (experimental): Switch directly to a GitHub PR by number. Same-repo PRs delegate to normal switch flow; fork PRs fetch from refs/pull/N/head and configure pushRemote. ([#673](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/673), closes [#657](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/657), thanks @wladpaiva for requesting)
- **`--force` hint for dirty worktrees**: When `wt remove` fails due to uncommitted changes, the hint now shows the full command: `wt remove <branch> --force`. ([#671](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/671))

### Documentation

- **Windows install guidance**: Winget as recommended install (ships `git-wt` by default), plus the App Execution Aliases workaround to use `wt` directly. Closes [#133](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/133). (thanks @ctolkien for reporting, @shanselman for the aliases tip, @Farley-Chen for [#648](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/648))
- **Caddy subdomain routing pattern**: Clean URLs like `feature-auth.myproject.lvh.me` via Caddy reverse proxy with dynamic route registration.
- **tmux session per worktree pattern**: Dedicated tmux session with multi-pane layout per worktree.

## 0.14.2

### Fixed

- **`wt remove --force` works with dirty worktrees**: The `--force` flag was documented to allow removal with uncommitted changes, but worktrunk's own cleanliness check blocked it before git could apply the flag. Fixes [#658](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/658). (thanks @pedro93)
- **Correct output when switching to existing local branch**: When switching to a local branch that tracks a remote, worktrunk incorrectly reported "Created branch X" instead of "Created worktree for X". Now only reports branch creation when git's DWIM actually creates a new tracking branch from a remote. Fixes [#656](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/656). (thanks @guidupuy-ws)
- **PowerShell handles multiple `wt.exe` binaries**: On Windows, when both Windows Terminal's `wt.exe` and worktrunk's `wt.exe` exist in PATH, shell integration errored with "Cannot convert 'System.Object[]' to the type 'System.String'". Now correctly uses the first match. Relates to [#648](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/648). (thanks @Farley-Chen)

## 0.14.1

### Improved

- **`--base` accepts commit-ish refs**: `wt switch --create --base` now accepts HEAD, tags, commit SHAs, and relative refs (e.g., `HEAD~2`), not just branch names. Fixes [#630](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/630). (thanks @myhau)
- **Upfront validation for target refs**: `wt merge` and `wt step` commands now validate target refs before approval prompts, giving clearer "Branch X not found" errors immediately.
- **Visual hierarchy in help**: Section dividers, improved heading structure, and sentence case in `--help` output.

### Fixed

- **macOS shell freeze during `copy-ignored`**: Atomic `clonefile()` on directories saturated disk I/O, blocking shell startup. Now uses per-file reflink which is slower but keeps the system responsive.
- **`copy-ignored` no longer copies nested worktrees**: When `worktree-path` places worktrees inside the main worktree, `copy-ignored` now skips them. Also now copies symlinks (fixes `node_modules/.bin/` etc.). Fixes [#641](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/641). (thanks @razor-x)
- **Context-aware hints for `wt config create`**: Hints now suggest relevant next steps based on which configs exist.

## 0.14.0

### Improved

- **`worktree_path_of_branch(branch)` template function**: Look up the filesystem path of any branch's worktree in hooks. Enables copying files between worktrees: `setup = "cp {{ worktree_path_of_branch('main') }}/config.local {{ worktree_path }}"`. Returns empty string if no worktree exists for the branch.
- **Per-task timeout for `wt list`**: Configure timeout for git operations via `[list] timeout-ms` in user config. Shows timeout count in footer. Use `--full` to disable timeout for complete data collection.
- **Atomic COW directory cloning on macOS**: `wt step copy-ignored` uses `clonefile()` syscall on APFS for O(1) directory cloning instead of file-by-file copying. ~12-15x faster for large directories like `target/`.
- **Template variable renamed**: `main_worktree_path` → `primary_worktree_path` for clarity. Old name still works with deprecation warning.

### Fixed

- **`wt step copy-ignored` in bare repositories**: Fixed "this operation must be run in a work tree" error when using bare repo setups. Closes [#598](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/598). (thanks @sbennett33 for reporting)

### Internal

- **Help system extraction**: Moved help and invocation utilities from main.rs to dedicated modules.
- **`wt list` model refactor**: Split monolithic model.rs into modular directory structure.

## 0.13.4

### Fixed

- **LESS flag concatenation with long options**: Fixed "invalid option" error when users have long options in LESS (e.g., `LESS=--mouse`). The pager auto-quit feature from v0.13.1 now correctly separates flags. Fixes [#594](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/594). (thanks @tnlanh for reporting)

### Internal

- **Homebrew formula generation**: Release workflow now uses cargo-dist for Homebrew formula generation, simplifying the release process.

## 0.13.2

### Improved

- **Validate before approval prompts**: `wt switch` and `wt remove` now validate operations before prompting for hook approval, so users don't approve hooks for operations that will fail.

### Fixed

- **Homebrew formula SHA256 hashes**: Fixed release workflow that was setting incorrect checksums for Intel and Linux binaries, causing `brew install` to fail. Fixes [#589](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/589). (thanks @kobrigo for reporting)

## 0.13.1

### Fixed

- **Pager auto-quit**: Help text now auto-quits when it fits on screen, even when `LESS` is set without the `F` flag (common with oh-my-zsh's `LESS=-R` default). Fixes [#583](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/583). (thanks @razor-x for reporting)
- **`--create` hint for remote branch shadowing**: Improved recovery hint when `--create` shadows a remote branch — now shows the full recovery command.

## 0.13.0

### Improved

- **`wt list` parallelization improvements**: Better parallelization of worktree operations reduce latency in some conditions. Respects `RAYON_NUM_THREADS` environment variable for controlling parallelism.
- **Template variables in `--execute`**: Hook template variables (`{{ branch }}`, `{{ worktree_path }}`, etc.) are now expanded in `--execute` commands and trailing args. With `--create`, `{{ base }}` and `{{ base_worktree_path }}` are also available.
- **Fish shell Homebrew compatibility**: Fish shell integration now installs to `~/.config/fish/functions/wt.fish` instead of `conf.d/`, ensuring PATH is fully configured before the wt function loads. `wt config show` detects legacy installations and `wt config shell install` handles migration automatically. ([#586](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/586) — thanks @ekans & @itzlambda)
- **Chrome Trace Format export**: Performance traces can be exported for analysis with Chrome's trace viewer or Perfetto.
- **`--dry-run` flag for shell commands**: `wt config shell install` and `wt config shell uninstall` now support `--dry-run` to preview changes without prompting.
- **Nested subcommand suggestions**: When typing `wt squash` instead of `wt step squash`, the error now suggests the correct command path.
- **Orphan branch indicator**: `wt list` shows `∅` (empty set) for orphan branches with no common ancestor to the default branch.
- **Improved `-vv` diagnostic workflow**: Bug reporting hint now uses a gist workflow to avoid URL length limits.

### Fixed

- **`wt switch --create --base` error message**: Now correctly identifies the invalid base branch instead of the target branch. Fixes [#562](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/562). (thanks @fablefactor)
- **AheadBehind column loading indicator**: Shows `⋯` when not yet loaded instead of appearing empty, distinguishing loading state from "in sync".
- **Post-merge hook failure output**: Simplified error messages and removed confusing `--no-verify` hint.
- **`wt select` log preview**: Graph structure is now preserved when displaying commit history, and columns dynamically align.

### Documentation

- **FAQ entry for shell setup issues**: Added troubleshooting guidance for common shell integration problems.
- **Template variables reference**: Consolidated template variables documentation into hook.md.
- **Clarified `--force` vs `-D` flags**: Updated `wt remove` documentation. (thanks @hlee-cb)
- **Performance benchmarks**: Added documentation for `copy-ignored` performance.

## 0.12.0

### Improved

- **`wt select --branches` and `--remotes` flags**: Control which items appear in the selection UI. Shares the `[list]` config section with `wt list` for consistent defaults.
- **Graceful degradation when default branch unavailable**: When the default branch cannot be determined (e.g., misconfigured), `wt list` shows warnings and empty cells rather than failing. `wt switch --create` without `--base` gives a clear error message.
- **Remove `--refresh` flag from state commands**: `wt config state default-branch get` and `wt config state ci-status get` now purely read cached state. To force re-detection, use the explicit workflow: `clear` then `get`. (Breaking: `--refresh` flag removed)
- **Windows: Require Git for Windows**: Removed PowerShell fallback. Worktrunk now requires Git for Windows (Git Bash) and shows a clear error message pointing to the download page if not found. (Breaking: PowerShell no longer supported)

### Fixed

- **Flag styling in messages**: Flags like `--clobber` and `--no-verify` in parentheses now inherit message color instead of using bright-black styling.
- **Nix flake**: Remove apple_sdk framework dependency. ([#525](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/525), thanks @MattiasMTS)
- **`gh issue create` hint**: Now includes `--web` flag to open the issue form in browser.

### Internal

- **Binary size reduced ~1MB**: Trimmed unused config/minijinja features (13MB → 12MB).
- **Repository module split**: Split 2200-line module into 8 focused submodules for maintainability.

## 0.11.0

### Improved

- **Nix flake for packaging**: New `flake.nix` for Nix users with crane for efficient Rust builds. ([#502](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/502), thanks @marktoda; thanks @Kabilan108 for requesting)
- **`sanitize_db` template filter**: New filter that transforms strings into database-safe identifiers with a 3-character hash suffix for collision/keyword safety. ([#498](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/498), thanks @hugobarauna for requesting)
- **`wt select` performance**: 500ms timeout for git commands improves TUI responsiveness on large repos with many branches. (thanks @KidkArolis for reporting [#461](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/461))
- **`wt select` stale branch handling**: Branches 50+ commits behind the default branch now skip expensive operations, showing `...` in the diff column. Improves performance on repos with many stale branches.
- **Global merge-base cache**: Cached merge-base results improve `wt list` performance by avoiding redundant git calls.
- **`wt config show` git version**: Now displays the git version alongside the worktrunk version.
- **`wt step copy-ignored` default**: Now copies all gitignored files by default. Use `.worktreeinclude` to limit what gets copied (previously required `.worktreeinclude` to specify what to copy).
- **Trace log analysis**: New `analyze-trace` binary for analyzing `[wt-trace]` performance logs.

### Fixed

- **Statusline truncation**: No longer truncates when terminal width is unknown, fixing Claude Code statusline display.
- **Shell completions**: Deprecated args like `--no-background` no longer appear in tab completions.
- **`wt remove` progress ordering**: Progress message now appears after pre-remove hooks, not before.
- **`wt list` index lock**: Uses `--no-optional-locks` for git status to avoid lock contention with parallel tasks.

## 0.10.0

### Improved

- **`wt step copy-ignored`**: Copy gitignored files listed in `.worktreeinclude` between worktrees. Useful for syncing `.env` files, IDE settings, and build caches to new worktrees via post-create hooks. Uses COW (reflink) copying for efficient handling of large directories. Matches Claude Code Desktop's worktree file syncing behavior.
- **`--foreground` flag**: Debug background hooks by running them in the foreground. Available on `wt hook post-start`, `wt hook post-switch`, and `wt remove`. Replaces the deprecated `--no-background` flag.
- **`--var` flag for hooks**: Override template variables when running hooks manually, e.g., `wt hook post-create --var target=main`.
- **`ci.platform` config**: Explicitly set CI platform (`github` or `gitlab`) for GitHub Enterprise or self-hosted GitLab where URL-based detection fails.
- **Upstream diff in `wt select`**: Tab 4 shows ahead/behind diff vs upstream tracking branch (remote⇅), matching the column in `wt list`.
- **`{{ base }}` and `{{ base_worktree_path }}` variables**: New template variables for creation hooks (post-create, post-start, post-switch) to access the base branch name and worktree path.
- **`-vv` diagnostic reports**: Double-verbose flag writes a diagnostic report to `.git/wt-logs/diagnostic.md` with environment info, configs, and logs for easy bug reporting.

### Fixed

- **Warning ordering**: Warnings about state discovered during evaluation now appear before the action message, making them feel like considered observations rather than afterthoughts.
- **Config validation in `wt config show`**: Now validates TOML syntax and schema, displaying parse errors with details.

### Documentation

- **Undocumented features**: Added documentation for `--show-prompt` and `--stage` flags on `wt step commit/squash`, `skip-shell-integration-prompt` config, and `[select] pager` config.

## 0.9.5

### Improved

- **Pager config for `wt select`**: New `[select] pager` config option to customize the diff pager in `wt select` previews. Auto-detects delta/bat when not configured.
- **Infinity symbol for extreme diffs**: `wt list` shows `∞` instead of `9K` for diffs >= 10,000 commits, avoiding misleading values.

### Fixed

- **Windows shell integration message**: Warning now shows just the command name instead of the full absolute path, and gives targeted advice when only the `.exe` suffix differs.
- **URL column width**: Column width in `wt list` now accounts for hyperlink display showing just `:PORT` instead of full URLs.

### Internal

- **Deprecated `template-file` and `squash-template-file`**: Legacy LLM template config options now show deprecation warnings.
- **Path handling improvements**: Replaced string manipulation with proper Path/PathBuf stdlib methods throughout the codebase.

## 0.9.4

### Improved

- **Diagnostic report generation**: `wt list --verbose` generates diagnostic reports (`.git/wt-logs/diagnostic.md`) when warnings or errors occur, with a `gh issue create` command hint when GitHub CLI is available.
- **Alias bypass detection**: `wt config show` detects shell aliases that point to binary paths (e.g., `alias gwt="/usr/bin/wt"`) and warns that they bypass shell integration with suggested fixes.
- **Switch message clarity**: Messages now explicitly state what was created — "Created branch X and worktree" vs "Created worktree for X" vs "Switched to worktree for X".
- **Worktree-path hint**: One-time hint after first `wt switch --create` suggesting `wt config create` to customize worktree locations.
- **Path mismatch warnings**: `wt remove` and `wt merge` show warnings when worktree paths don't match the config template.
- **CLI command ordering**: Commands reordered by usage frequency in `--help` (switch, list, remove, merge...).

### Fixed

- **Progress counter overflow**: Fixed `wt list` progressive rendering when URL sends caused completed count to exceed expected count.
- **Windows shell integration**: Shell function now correctly strips `.exe` suffix, relying on MSYS2/Git Bash automatic resolution (fixes [#348](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/348)).
- **Prunable worktrees**: Gracefully handle worktrees where the directory was deleted but git still tracks metadata.
- **Help text tables**: Disabled clap text wrapping to preserve markdown tables in `--help` output.

### Documentation

- **FAQ entries**: Added entries for "What files does Worktrunk create?" and "What can Worktrunk delete?".

### Internal

- **Hint state management**: New `wt config state hints` subcommand for viewing and clearing shown hints.
- **Deprecated config deduplication**: Migration files (`.new`) only written once per repo, tracked via git config hints.

## 0.9.3

### Improved

- **Terminal hyperlinks for URLs**: The URL column in `wt list` now shows clickable links (OSC 8) in supported terminals, displaying a compact `:port` that links to the full URL.
- **Statusline truncation**: Statusline output now intelligently truncates by dropping low-priority segments (URL, CI) before high-priority ones (branch, model) when exceeding terminal width.
- **Statusline URL**: When a project has a `[list] url` template configured, the URL now appears in statusline output for shell prompts.
- **Bare repo default branch detection**: Uses `symbolic-ref HEAD` as a heuristic for detecting the default branch in bare repos and empty repos before the first commit.
- **Terminology**: Renamed "path mismatch" to "branch-worktree mismatch" for clarity. In JSON output (`wt list --format=json`), the field `path_mismatch` is now `branch_worktree_mismatch`.

### Fixed

- **Empty bare repo bootstrap**: `wt switch --create main` now works in empty bare repos by handling unborn branches correctly.

### Documentation

- **CLI help text**: Improved descriptions across multiple commands including `wt`, `wt list`, `wt select`, `wt step`, `wt merge`, `wt remove`, and `wt hook`.
- **Web docs copy button**: Fixed copy button position so it stays at top-right when scrolling horizontally through code blocks.

### Internal

- **Claude Code plugin detection**: `wt config show` now displays whether the worktrunk Claude Code plugin is installed, with install hints if needed.
- **Hyperlink diagnostics**: `wt config show` shows hyperlink support status (active/inactive).

## 0.9.2

### Fixed

- **Locked worktree detection**: `wt remove` now detects locked worktrees upfront and shows a clear error with unlock instructions, instead of reporting success but silently failing. ([#408](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/408), [#412](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/412))
- **Windows Git Bash shell integration**: Shell detection now handles Windows-style paths in `$SHELL` (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\bash.exe`). Fixes [#348](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/348). ([#398](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/398))

### Documentation

- **CLI help text clarity**: Improved descriptions for `wt`, `wt list`, `wt step push`, `wt step squash`, `wt remove`, and `wt config state`. ([#410](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/410))
- **Installation commands**: Removed `$` prefixes from install commands for easier copy-paste. ([#405](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/405), thanks @muzzlol)

### Internal

- **Home worktree lookup**: Centralized with `find_home()` and `home_path()` methods for more consistent behavior with bare repos.
- **Windows CI**: Added cross-platform mock infrastructure for testing Windows-specific behavior.

## 0.9.1

### Improved

- **Shell integration debug info**: `wt config show` now displays invocation details (path, git subcommand mode, explicit path usage) to help diagnose shell integration issues. "Shell integration not active" is now a warning instead of a hint.

## 0.9.0

### Improved

- **Shell integration prompt**: When shell integration isn't active after `wt switch`, an interactive prompt offers to install it. The prompt remembers your choice and falls back to a hint for non-TTY environments.
- **Template variable names**: Renamed for clarity: `repo_root` → `repo_path`, `worktree` → `worktree_path`, `main_worktree` → `repo`. Added `main_worktree_path` for accessing the main worktree's absolute path. Deprecated names work with migration warnings and auto-generated `.new` config files.
- **Shell integration warnings**: Specific diagnostic messages when shell cd won't work: "shell integration not installed", "shell requires restart", "ran ./wt; shell integration wraps wt", or "ran git wt; running through git prevents cd".
- **RUNTIME section in `wt config show`**: Displays binary name, version, and shell integration status to help debug invocation issues.
- **Clickable CI indicator**: The CI status indicator (●) in `wt list` output is now a clickable link to the PR in terminals that support OSC 8 hyperlinks.
- **`wt switch` help text**: Clarifies the difference from `git switch` and documents common failure conditions.

### Fixed

- **Hook path display**: Hook announcements show the execution path when shell integration isn't active.
- **Approval matching with deprecated vars**: Approvals now match regardless of whether they were saved with deprecated or current variable names.
- **Documentation filter syntax**: Fixed incorrect Jinja filter examples that showed `~` concatenation with `|` filter without parentheses. ([#373](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/373), thanks @coriocactus)

### Documentation

- **Pre-remove hook example**: Added pattern for cleaning up background processes (e.g., killing dev servers) when worktrees are removed.

## 0.8.5

### Improved

- **Windows `git-wt` command**: Winget now ships with `git-wt` as a workaround to the Windows Terminal `wt` naming conflict. We're still considering better options — see [#133](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/133).

## 0.8.4

### Improved

- **Shell integration detection**: More robust detection of `git wt` (space) vs `git-wt` patterns. `wt config show` now displays line numbers for detected shell integration.
- **Windows `wt select` error**: Shows a helpful error message with alternatives instead of "unrecognized subcommand".

### Fixed

- **Markdown table rendering**: Escaped pipe characters (`\|`) in help output now render correctly.
- **Dim styling on wrapped lines**: Dim text attribute now preserved on continuation lines when text wraps.
- **Path occupied hint**: Fixed tilde expansion issue where `~/...` paths didn't work in shell commands.

### Documentation

- **Hook design guide**: Added comprehensive guide for designing hooks.
- **Command docs**: Added `wt config show` to command documentation.
- **Windows paths**: Documented MSYS2 auto path conversion for Windows shell integration.

### Internal

- **Output system**: Consolidated output functions, removed redundant aliases.
- **Zsh compinit**: Improved handling of "insecure directories" warning in tests.

## 0.8.3

### Improved

- **Hook execution path**: Shows the execution path when post-merge hooks run in a different directory than where the user invoked the command (e.g., with `--no-remove`).
- **TTY check for `wt select`**: Now fails gracefully when run in a non-interactive terminal instead of hanging.
- **Background hooks**: `post-start` and `post-switch` hooks spawn in background via stdin piping, matching their normal behavior during `wt switch`.
- **Occupied path error message**: When a worktree path is occupied by a different branch, the error now explains the situation clearly and suggests `git switch`.
- **Shell integration hint**: Shows a hint to restart the shell when shell integration is configured but not active.
- **Message style**: Removed 2nd person pronouns ("you/your") from user-facing messages following CLI guidelines.

### Fixed

- **`wt hook post-start` blocking**: Fixed bug where `wt hook post-start` ran in foreground blocking the command, instead of spawning in background like during normal `wt switch --create`.
- **Approval bypass with `project:` prefix**: Fixed security issue where using `project:` filter prefix (e.g., `wt hook pre-merge project:`) bypassed the approval check, allowing unapproved project commands to run.

### Documentation

- **License file**: Added combined MIT and Apache-2.0 license file.
- **Demo GIFs**: Added demo GIFs to command pages on the documentation site.
- **Install instructions**: Simplified to single-line commands.

### Internal

- **Pre-commit hooks**: Updated to immutable tags.
- **Lychee exclusions**: Cleaned up link checker configuration.

## 0.8.2

### Improved

- **Concurrent hook execution**: `wt hook post-start` and `wt hook post-switch` now run all commands concurrently (matching their normal background behavior) instead of sequentially with fail-fast. Multiple failures are collected and reported together.

### Documentation

- **Nested bare repo layout**: Added worktree-path template example for nested bare repo layout (`project/.git` pattern). Uses relative paths like `../{{ branch | sanitize }}` to create worktrees as siblings to the .git directory.

## 0.8.1

### Improved

- **Shell and PowerShell installers**: Added one-line install commands for Linux/macOS and Windows.
- **Consistent terminology**: CLI now uses "branch name" consistently instead of mixing "worktree" and "branch". The `wt remove` argument is renamed from `worktrees` to `branches` to reflect that worktrees are addressed by branch name.

### Fixed

- **Switch hints**: Removed incorrect `wt switch @` hint and improved error output spacing.

### Documentation

- **Dev server and database patterns**: Added practical examples for running per-worktree dev servers with subdomain routing and databases with unique ports.

## 0.8.0

### Improved

- **Separate `--yes` and `--force` flags**: `--force/-f` renamed to `--yes/-y` for skipping prompts (all commands). New `--force/-f` on `wt remove` forces removal of worktrees with untracked files (build artifacts, node_modules, etc.). (Breaking: `--force` no longer skips prompts; use `--yes`)
- **Clearer branch deletion output**: `wt remove` output now shows "worktree & branch" when the branch is deleted, or plain "worktree" with a hint when kept. Makes scanning output for branch fate easier.
- **`post-switch` hook on remove**: When `wt remove` switches to the main worktree, post-switch hooks now run in the destination.
- **Allow merge commits by default**: `wt step push` no longer rejects history with merge commits. Removed `--allow-merge-commits` flag. (Breaking: flag removed)

### Fixed

- **Orphan branches in `wt list`**: Branches with no common ancestor with the default branch no longer cause errors.
- **Remote branch filtering**: `wt list --remotes` now filters out branches that are tracked as upstreams, not just branches with worktrees.
- **Error message spacing**: Reduced double-newline spacing in error messages.

## 0.7.0

### Improved

- **Working tree conflict detection**: `wt list --full` now detects conflicts using uncommitted working tree changes, not just committed content. This catches conflicts earlier—before committing changes that would conflict with the target branch.
- **Dev server URL column**: New optional URL column in `wt list` configured via `[list] url` template in project config (`.config/wt.toml`). URLs show with health-check styling: normal if the port is listening, dimmed otherwise.
- **Shell integration simplification**: The shell wrapper is now self-contained with all directive handling inlined. Removes the separate helper function that could become unavailable if shell initialization order changed.
- **Performance**: Repository caching reduces git subprocess spawns; parallelized pre-skeleton operations for faster initial display.
- **Improved error hints**: When a worktree path already exists during creation, the error hint now correctly suggests `--create --clobber`.

### Fixed

- **Docs syntax highlighting**: Fixed syntax highlighting colors being stripped by 1Password browser extension on the documentation site.

## 0.6.1

### Improved

- **`post-switch` hook**: New hook that runs in the background after every `wt switch` operation. Unlike `post-start` (which only runs on creation), `post-switch` runs on all switch results. Use cases include renaming terminal tabs, updating tmux window names, and IDE notifications.
- **Signal forwarding for hooks**: Hooks now receive SIGINT/SIGTERM when the parent process is interrupted, allowing proper cleanup. Previously, non-interactive shells continued executing after signals.
- **Faster `wt list` skeleton**: Time-to-skeleton reduced by caching default branch lookup, batching timestamp fetching, and deferring non-essential git operations. Skeleton shows `·` placeholder for gutter symbols until data loads.
- **Clearer `--clobber` hint**: Error message now says "to overwrite (with backup)" instead of "to retry with backup".

### Documentation

- **State side-effects**: Added section explaining how Worktrunk state operations may trigger git commands.
- **`wt merge` location**: Clarified that `wt merge` runs from the feature worktree.

## 0.6.0

### Improved

- **Single-width Unicode symbols**: Replaced emojis (🔄, ✅, ❌) with single-width Unicode symbols (◎, ✓, ✗, ▲, ↳, ○, ❯) for better terminal compatibility and consistent alignment.
- **Output system overhaul**: Clean separation of output channels (data→stdout, status→stderr, directives→file) means piping works with shell integration active. `wt list --format=json | jq` and `wt switch feature | tee log.txt` both work correctly. Background processes use `process_group(0)` instead of `nohup` for more reliable detachment.
- **Trailing arguments for `--execute`**: `wt switch --execute` now accepts arguments after `--`, enabling shell aliases like `alias wsc='wt switch --create -x claude'` then `wsc feature -- 'implement login'`.
- **`hash_port` template filter**: `{{ branch | hash_port }}` hashes the branch name to a deterministic port number (10000-19999), useful for running dev servers without port conflicts.
- **`sanitize` template filter**: `{{ branch | sanitize }}` explicitly replaces `/` and `\` with `-` for filesystem-safe paths. (Breaking: `{{ branch }}` now provides raw branch names. Update templates that use `{{ branch }}` in filesystem paths to use `{{ branch | sanitize }}` instead)
- **Log directory in state output**: `wt config state logs` and `wt config state get` now show the log directory path under a LOG FILES heading.
- **Actionable error hints**: Error messages now include hints about what command to run next.
- **Unified directory change output**: `wt remove` now shows "Switched to worktree for {branch} @ {path}" matching `wt switch` format.
- **Consistent "already up to date" formatting**: Standardized message wording and styling across commands.

### Fixed

- **`wt step rebase` with merge commits**: Fixed incorrect "Already up-to-date" when a branch has merge commits from merging target into itself.

### Documentation

- **Local CI workflow**: Added "Local CI" section to `wt merge --help` explaining how pre-merge hooks enable faster iteration.
- **Colored command reference**: Web docs now preserve ANSI colors in command reference output.
- **Clarified terminology**: Help text uses "default branch" instead of hardcoded "main".

## 0.5.2

### Improved

- **`--clobber` flag for `wt switch`**: When encountering a stale directory or file at the target worktree path, `--clobber` moves it to a timestamped `.bak` file instead of failing.
- **Relative paths in `wt list`**: Paths are now shown relative to the main worktree (`.`, `./subdir`, `../repo.feature`) instead of a computed common prefix that could degenerate to `/`.
- **Multiline error formatting**: Errors with context now show a header describing what worktrunk was trying to do, with the full error chain in a gutter block.
- **Semantic switch messaging**: Switching to an existing worktree now shows ⚪ (info) instead of ✅ (success), reflecting that nothing was created.

### Fixed

- **Symbol styling in removal messages**: Integration symbols (`_`, `⊂`) now render in their canonical dim appearance instead of inheriting the message's cyan color.
- **ConflictingChanges error formatting**: Fixed double newlines in the error message output.

## 0.5.1

### Improved

- **Integration status in removal messages**: Shows integration symbols (`_` for same commit, `⊂` for integrated) when removing worktrees, matching `wt list` display.
- **Concurrent command limiting**: Limits concurrent git processes to 32 (configurable via `WORKTRUNK_MAX_CONCURRENT_COMMANDS`), preventing resource exhaustion on repos with many branches.
- **Better error display for `wt list`**: Task errors are now collected and displayed as warnings after the table renders, instead of being silently swallowed.
- **Remove continues on partial failures**: `wt remove` continues removing other worktrees when some fail, reporting all errors at the end.
- **Bash syntax highlighting**: Shell commands in error gutters now have syntax highlighting.
- **Shell integration is command-aware**: Detection and removal works correctly when installed as `git-wt` or other names.
- **CI fetch error documentation**: Yellow warning symbol (⚠) in CI column is now documented in help text.

### Fixed

- **CI status with multiple workflows**: Fixed incorrect status when multiple workflows exist (e.g., `ci` and `publish-docs`). Now uses GitHub's check-runs API to aggregate all workflow statuses.
- **State storage unification**: Unified branch-keyed state under `worktrunk.state.<branch>.*`. Numeric branch names now work. (Existing CI cache and markers regenerate on first access)

### Internal

- **Environment variable prefix**: Standardized to `WORKTRUNK_` prefix (e.g., `WORKTRUNK_MAX_CONCURRENT_COMMANDS`).
- Automatic winget package publishing on releases.

## 0.5.0

### Improved

- **Path column hidden when redundant**: Path column is deprioritized when all paths match the naming template, showing only at wider terminal widths (~125+ columns).
- **Better error formatting**: Errors with context now show a header with the root cause in a gutter block, improving readability for git errors.
- **Clearer integration target**: Separated `default_branch` (for stats like ahead/behind) from `target` (for integration checks), catching branches merged remotely before pulling.

### Fixed

- **Untracked files block integration**: Untracked files now prevent a worktree from being flagged as integrated, avoiding accidental data loss on removal.
- **Dirty worktree count includes untracked**: Summary now correctly counts worktrees with untracked files as dirty.
- **Branch name disambiguation**: Fixed `refname:short` issues when a branch and remote have the same name.
- **JSON output uses kebab-case**: Enum values changed from snake_case to kebab-case (e.g., `same_commit` → `same-commit`). (Breaking: scripts parsing JSON output may need updates)
- **Legacy marker format removed**: Plain-text markers no longer parsed. (Breaking: re-set markers with `wt config state marker set`)

### Internal

- **Unified command execution**: All external commands now go through `shell_exec::run()` for consistent logging and tracing.

## 0.4.0

### Added

- **`--no-rebase` flag for `wt merge`**: Fails early with a clear error if the branch is not already rebased onto target, rather than auto-rebasing. Useful for workflows that handle rebasing separately. ([#194](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/194))

### Changed

- **Branch-first argument resolution**: `wt switch` and `wt remove` now check if the branch has a worktree anywhere before checking the expected path. If you type `wt switch foo`, you get branch foo's worktree, not whatever happens to be at the expected path. ([#197](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/197))

### Fixed

- **`--no-commit` incorrectly skipped rebasing**: `wt merge --no-commit` now correctly rebases before stopping (if needed), rather than skipping the rebase entirely. ([#194](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/194))
- **Pager for `wt config show --full`**: The pager now works correctly with the `--full` flag, showing diagnostics properly. ([#198](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/198))
- **Statusline stdin handling**: Fixed flaky behavior on Windows CI by using standard is_terminal() check instead of timeout-based approach. ([#210](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/210))

### Improved

- **Path-occupied error messages**: When `wt switch` can't create a worktree because the path exists, error messages now show which branch occupies the path and provide actionable commands to fix the situation. ([#195](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/195), [#206](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/206), [#207](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/207))
- **Switch mismatch detection**: Better error messages when path/branch mismatches occur, with hints showing the expected path. ([#195](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/195))

## 0.3.1

### Fixed

- **Branch names with slashes**: Branch names like `fix/feature-name` no longer break git config markers. Slashes are now escaped for git config compatibility. ([#189](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/189), thanks @kyleacmooney)
- **stdin inheritance for `--execute`**: Interactive programs (vim, python -i, claude) now work correctly with `--execute` on non-Unix platforms. ([#191](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/191))
- **Filenames with spaces/newlines**: Git status parsing now handles filenames containing spaces and newlines correctly using NUL-separated output.
- **Concurrent approval race condition**: Multiple concurrent approval/revocation operations no longer overwrite each other. Approvals now reload from disk before saving.
- **Dirty worktrees incorrectly marked integrated**: Priority 5 integration check now requires clean working tree state, preventing worktrees with uncommitted changes from being flagged as safe to remove.
- **Type changes not detected as staged**: Index status check now recognizes file type changes (`T` status) as staged changes.
- **User hook failure strategy**: Hook failure strategy now correctly applies to user hooks instead of always using fail-fast.
- **Branch variable in detached HEAD**: `{{ branch }}` now correctly expands to "HEAD" in detached HEAD worktrees instead of "(detached)".

### Improved

- **Self-hosted GitLab support**: CI auth checks now detect the GitLab host from the remote URL, supporting self-hosted GitLab instances instead of always checking gitlab.com.
- **Platform-specific CI status**: `wt list --full` and `wt config show` now show only the relevant CI tool (GitHub Actions or GitLab CI) based on the repository's remote URL.
- **LLM error reproduction**: When LLM commands fail, error messages now show the full reproduction command (e.g., `wt step commit --show-prompt | llm`) for easier debugging.
- **Location format**: Messages now use `@` instead of `at` for location phrases (e.g., "Switched to feature @ /path").
- **Switch help text**: Clarified that `wt switch` creates worktrees automatically for existing branches, not just for new branches with `--create`.

## 0.3.0

### Added

- **`--show-prompt` flag for LLM commands**: `wt step commit --show-prompt` and `wt step squash --show-prompt` output the rendered LLM prompt without executing the command. Useful for debugging templates or manually piping to LLM tools. ([#187](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/187))
- **Diff size limits and diffstat for LLM prompts**: Large diffs (>400K chars) are progressively filtered—first removing lock files, then truncating to 50 lines/file, max 50 files. New `git_diff_stat` template variable shows line change statistics. ([#186](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/186))
- **`MainState::Empty` status**: New `_` symbol for clean same-commit branches (safe to delete), distinguished from `–` (en-dash) for same-commit branches with uncommitted changes. Previously, both showed `_`. Only Empty branches are dimmed and considered "potentially removable". ([#185](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/185))

### Changed

- **State subcommands default to `get`**: Running `wt config state default-branch` now defaults to `get`, making the command shorter. Use explicit `get` subcommand to access options like `--refresh` or `--branch`. ([#184](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/184))
- **Clearer integration reason messages**: Updated descriptions to be more precise—"same commit as" instead of "already in" for SameCommit, "ancestor of" for Ancestor, "no added changes" for NoAddedChanges, "tree matches" for TreesMatch.

## 0.2.1

### Changed

- **Unified state management**: `wt config var` and `wt config cache` replaced by `wt config state` with consistent get/set/clear semantics for all runtime state. New subcommands: `default-branch`, `ci-status`, `marker`, `logs`, `show`. ([#178](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/178))
- **Comprehensive state overview**: `wt config state show` displays all state (default branch, switch history, markers, CI cache, logs) with `--format=json` support. ([#180](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/180))

### Added

- **`git-wt` binary for Windows**: New `git-wt` binary avoids conflict with Windows Terminal's `wt` command. Build with `--features git-wt`. Shell init/install now accept `--cmd` to specify which binary name to use. ([#177](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/177))
- **Diffstat in select preview**: The log preview (Tab 2) in `wt select` now shows line change statistics (+N -M) matching `wt list`'s HEAD± column format. ([#179](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/179))

### Fixed

- **Windows compatibility**: Multiple test and runtime fixes for Windows including stdin timeout handling, path canonicalization, and cross-platform test behavior. ([#167](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/167), [#168](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/168), [#169](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/169), [#170](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/170), [#171](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/171), [#174](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/174), [#176](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/176))

## 0.1.21

### Fixed

- **Windows path handling in shell templates**: Fixed path quoting in hook templates on Windows by using `cygpath` to convert native Windows paths to POSIX format for Git Bash compatibility. Template variables like `{{ worktree }}` and `{{ repo_root }}` now work correctly. ([#161](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/161))
- **Hook errors show `--no-verify` hint**: When hooks fail during `wt merge`, `wt commit`, or `wt squash`, the error message now includes a hint about using `--no-verify` to skip hooks. ([4a89748](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/4a89748f))

## 0.1.20

### Changed

- **`--doctor` renamed to `--full`**: The `wt list --doctor` flag is now `wt list --full`. The new name better reflects that it shows extended information (binaries status, full diff stats). ([171952e](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/171952ec))
- **CLI binaries status in `wt config show --full`**: Shows installation and authentication status of `gh` and `glab` CLI tools in a new BINARIES section. ([171952e](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/171952ec))
- **CI tool hints**: `wt list --full` shows a hint when CI status is unavailable, with specific guidance on which CLI tool to install or authenticate. ([171952e](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/171952ec))

### Fixed

- **GitHub StatusContext checks**: CI status now includes StatusContext checks (used by some CI systems like Jenkins, CircleCI, and external status checks) in addition to CheckRuns. ([690da88](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/690da889))
- **Windows Git Bash detection with WSL**: Fixed detection of Git Bash when WSL is installed. Previously, the WSL bash shim in PATH could be found instead of Git Bash, causing hook execution failures. ([b48b0ba](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/b48b0ba7))

## 0.1.19

### Added

- **`wt step for-each` command**: Run commands across all worktrees sequentially. Supports template variables (`{{ branch }}`, `{{ worktree }}`, etc.) and JSON context on stdin. Example: `wt step for-each -- git pull --autostash`. ([#138](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/138))

### Changed

- **Content integration detection always enabled**: The `⊂` (content integrated) symbol now appears without requiring `--full`. Squash-merged branches are detected automatically. ([f39c442](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/f39c4428))
- **SIGINT forwarding**: Ctrl+C now properly terminates child processes in hooks, preventing orphaned background commands. ([#136](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/136))

### Fixed

- **Windows path handling**: Fixed path canonicalization issues on Windows that caused worktree detection failures. Uses `dunce` to handle Windows verbatim paths (`\\?\`) that git cannot process. ([#125](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/125))

## 0.1.18

### Added

- **Windows support**: Git Bash with PowerShell fallback enables worktrunk on Windows. Git Bash is preferred (same bash hook syntax across platforms); PowerShell works for basic commands with limitations. ([#122](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/122))
- **Winget publishing**: Release workflow now publishes to Windows Package Manager. ([079c9df](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/079c9df3))

### Changed

- **Approvals command moved**: `wt config approvals` is now `wt hook approvals` since approvals manage hook commands. ([b7b1b9e](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/b7b1b9e3))
- **Approval prompts show templates**: Approval prompts now display command templates (what gets saved) rather than expanded values. ([2315d26](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/2315d268))
- **Preview mode renamed**: The `history` preview mode is now `log` for clarity. ([0461152](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/04611524))

### Fixed

- **PR/MR source filtering**: Filter PRs by source repository instead of author, fixing false matches when multiple users have PRs with the same branch name. ([e9ccdf7](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/e9ccdf77))

## 0.1.17

### Added

- **User-level hooks**: Define hooks in `~/.config/wt.toml` that run for all repositories. New `wt hook show` command displays configured hooks and their sources. ([#118](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/118))
- **SSH URL support**: Git SSH URLs (e.g., `git@github.com:user/repo.git`) now work correctly for remote operations and branch name escaping. ([92c2cef](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/92c2cef8))
- **Help text wrapping**: CLI help text now wraps to terminal width for better readability. ([fe981c2](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/fe981c2e))

### Changed

- **JSON output redesign**: `wt list --format=json` now outputs a query-friendly format. This is a breaking change for existing JSON consumers. ([236eae8](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/236eae81))
- **Status symbols**: Reorganized status column symbols for better scannability. Same-commit now distinguished from ancestor in integration detection. ([5053af8](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/5053af88), [a087962](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/a0879623))

### Fixed

- **ANSI state reset**: Reset terminal ANSI state before returning to shell, preventing color bleeding into subsequent commands. ([334f6d9](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/334f6d99))
- **Empty staging error**: Fail early with a clear error when trying to generate a commit message with nothing staged. ([b9522bc](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/b9522bc6))

## 0.1.16

### Added

- **Squash-merge integration detection**: Improved branch cleanup detection with four ordered checks to identify when branch content is already in the target branch. This enables accurate removal of squash-merged branches even after target advances. New status symbols: `·` for same commit, `⊂` for content integrated via different history. ([6325be2](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/6325be28))
- **CI absence caching**: Cache "no CI found" results to avoid repeated API calls for branches without CI configured. Reduces unnecessary rate limit consumption. ([8db3928](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/8db39285))
- **Shell completion tests**: Black-box snapshot tests for zsh, bash, and fish completions that verify actual completion output. ([#117](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/117))

### Changed

- **Merge conflict indicator**: Changed from `⊘` to `⚔` (crossed swords) for better visual distinction from the rebase symbol. ([f3b96a8](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/f3b96a83))

### Documentation

- **Hook JSON context**: Document all JSON fields available to hooks on stdin with examples for Python and other languages. ([af80589](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/af805898))
- **CI caching**: Document that CI results are cached for 30-60 seconds and how to use `wt config cache` to manage the cache. ([4804913](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/48049132))
- **Status column clarifications**: Clarify that the Status column contains multiple subcolumns with priority ordering. ([1f9bb38](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/1f9bb38f))

## 0.1.15

### Added

- **`wt hook` command**: New command for running lifecycle hooks directly. Moved hook execution from `wt step` to `wt hook` for cleaner semantic separation. ([#113](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/113))
- **Named hook execution**: Run specific named commands with `wt hook <type> <name>` (e.g., `wt hook pre-merge test`). Includes shell completion for hook names from project config. ([#114](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/114))

### Fixed

- **Zsh completion syntax**: Fixed `_describe` syntax in zsh shell completions. ([6ae9d0f](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/6ae9d0f9))
- **Fish shell wrapper**: Fixed stderr redirection in fish shell wrapper. ([0301d4b](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/0301d4bf))
- **CI status for local branches**: Only check CI for branches with upstream tracking configured. ([6273ccd](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/6273ccdb))
- **Git error messages**: Include executed git command in error messages for easier debugging. ([200eea4](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/200eea43))

## 0.1.14

### Added

- **Pre-remove hook**: New `pre-remove` hook runs before worktree removal, enabling cleanup tasks like stopping devcontainers. Thanks to [@pwntester](https://github.com/pwntester) in [#101](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/101). ([#107](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/107))
- **JSON context on stdin**: Hooks now receive worktree context as JSON on stdin, enabling hooks in any language (Python, Node, Ruby, etc.) to access repo information. ([#109](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/109))
- **`wt config create --project`**: New flag to generate `.config/wt.toml` project config files directly. ([#110](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/110))

### Fixed

- **Shell completion bypass**: Fixed lazy shell completion to use `command` builtin, bypassing the shell function that was causing `_clap_dynamic_completer_wt` errors. Thanks to [@cquiroz](https://github.com/cquiroz) in [#102](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/102). ([#105](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/105))
- **Remote-only branch completions**: `wt remove` completions now exclude remote-only branches (which can't be removed) and show a helpful error with hint to use `wt switch`. ([#108](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/108))
- **Detached HEAD hooks**: Pre-remove hooks now work correctly on detached HEAD worktrees. ([#111](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/111))
- **Hook `{{ target }}` variable**: Fixed template variable expansion in standalone hook execution. ([#106](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/106))
