## Examples

Pre-approve all commands for current project:
```console
wt hook approvals add
```

Clear approvals for current project:
```console
wt hook approvals clear
```

Clear global approvals:
```console
wt hook approvals clear --global
```

## How approvals work

Approved commands are saved to `~/.config/worktrunk/approvals.toml`. Re-approval is required when the command template changes or the project moves. Use `--yes` to bypass prompts in CI."#
