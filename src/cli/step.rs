## Extra git diff arguments

Arguments after `--` are forwarded to `git diff`:

```console
wt step diff -- --stat
wt step diff -- --name-only
wt step diff -- -- '*.rs'
```

The diff is pipeable to tools like `delta`:

```console
wt step diff | delta
```

## How it works

Equivalent to:

```console
cp "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)/index" /tmp/idx
GIT_INDEX_FILE=/tmp/idx git add --intent-to-add .
GIT_INDEX_FILE=/tmp/idx git diff $(git merge-base HEAD $(wt config state default-branch))
```

`git diff` ignores untracked files. `git add --intent-to-add .` registers them in the index without staging their content, making them visible to `git diff`. This runs against a copy of the real index so the original is never modified.
"#

    Diff {
        /// Target branch
        ///
        /// Defaults to default branch.
        #[arg(add = crate::completion::branch_value_completer())]

        extra_args: Vec<String>,
    },

    ///
    /// Eliminates cold starts by copying build caches and dependencies.
    #[command(
        after_long_help = r#"Git worktrees share the repository but not untracked files. This command copies gitignored files to another worktree, eliminating cold starts.

## Setup

Add to the project config:

```toml
# .config/wt.toml
[post-start]
copy = "wt step copy-ignored"
```

## What gets copied

All gitignored files are copied by default, except for built-in excluded directories like `.conductor/`, `.entire/`, `.jj/`, `.pi/`, and `.worktrees/`. Tracked files are never touched.

To limit what gets copied further, create `.worktreeinclude` with gitignore-style patterns. Files must be **both** gitignored **and** in `.worktreeinclude`:

```text
# .worktreeinclude
.env
node_modules/
target/
```

After `.worktreeinclude` selects entries, you can add more gitignore-style excludes in user config, per-project user overrides, or project config:

```toml
[step.copy-ignored]
exclude = [".cache/", ".turbo/"]
```

Built-in excludes always apply. User config and project config exclusions are combined, and per-project user exclusions append to global user exclusions.

## Common patterns

| Type | Patterns |
|------|----------|
| Dependencies | `node_modules/`, `.venv/`, `target/`, `vendor/`, `Pods/` |
| Build caches | `.cache/`, `.next/`, `.parcel-cache/`, `.turbo/` |
| Generated assets | Images, ML models, binaries too large for git |
| Environment files | `.env` (if not generated per-worktree) |

## Features

- Uses copy-on-write (reflink) when available for space-efficient copies
- Handles nested `.gitignore` files, global excludes, and `.git/info/exclude`
- Skips existing files by default (safe to re-run)
- `--force` overwrites existing files in the destination
- Always skips built-in excluded directories like `.conductor/`, `.entire/`, `.jj/`, `.pi/`, `.worktrees/`, other VCS metadata directories, and nested worktrees

## Performance

Reflink copies share disk blocks until modified — no data is actually copied. For a 14GB `target/` directory:

| Command | Time |
|---------|------|
| `cp -R` (full copy) | 2m |
| `cp -Rc` / `wt step copy-ignored` | 20s |

Uses per-file reflink (like `cp -Rc`) — copy time scales with file count.

Use the `post-start` hook so the copy runs in the background. Use `pre-start` instead if subsequent hooks or `--execute` command need the copied files immediately.

## Language-specific notes

### Rust

The `target/` directory is huge (often 1-10GB). Copying with reflink cuts first build from ~68s to ~3s by reusing compiled dependencies.

### Node.js

`node_modules/` is large but mostly static. If the project has no native dependencies, symlinks are even faster:

```toml
[pre-start]
deps = "ln -sf {{ primary_worktree_path }}/node_modules ."
```

### Python

Virtual environments contain absolute paths and can't be copied. Use `uv sync` instead — it's fast enough that copying isn't worth it.

## Behavior vs Claude Code on desktop

The `.worktreeinclude` pattern is shared with [Claude Code on desktop](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/desktop), which copies matching files when creating worktrees. Differences:

- worktrunk copies all gitignored files by default; Claude Code requires `.worktreeinclude`
- worktrunk uses copy-on-write for large directories like `target/` — potentially 30x faster on macOS, 6x on Linux
- worktrunk runs as a configurable hook in the worktree lifecycle

Use in shell substitution:

```console

```

Combine multiple values:

```console
$ wt step eval '{{ branch | hash_port }},{{ ("supabase-api-" ~ branch) | hash_port }}'
16066,16739
```

Use conditionals and filters:

```console
$ wt step eval '{{ branch | sanitize_db }}'

Context JSON is piped to stdin for scripts that need structured data.

## Template variables

All variables are shell-escaped. See [`wt hook` template variables](@/hook.md#template-variables) for the complete list and filters.

## Examples

Check status across all worktrees:

```console
wt step for-each -- git status --short
```

Run npm install in all worktrees:

```console
wt step for-each -- npm install
```

Use branch name in command:

```console
wt step for-each -- "echo Branch: {{ branch }}"
```

Pull updates in worktrees with upstreams (skips others):

```console
git fetch --prune && wt step for-each -- '[ "$(git rev-parse @{u} 2>/dev/null)" ] || exit 0; git pull --autostash'
```

Note: This command is experimental and may change in future versions.

The idiomatic Worktrunk workflow does not use `promote`; instead each worktree has a full environment. `promote` is the only Worktrunk command which changes a branch in an existing worktree.

## Example

```console
# from ~/project (main worktree)
$ wt step promote feature
```

Before:

```
  Branch   Path
@ main     ~/project
+ feature  ~/project.feature
```

After:

```
  Branch   Path
@ feature  ~/project
+ main     ~/project.feature
```

To restore: `wt step promote main` from anywhere, or just `wt step promote` from the main worktree.

Without an argument, promotes the current branch — or restores the default branch if run from the main worktree.

## Requirements

- Both worktrees must be clean
- The branch must have an existing worktree

## Gitignored files

Gitignored files (build artifacts, `node_modules/`, `.env`) are swapped along with the branches so each worktree keeps the artifacts that belong to its branch. Files are discovered using the same mechanism as [`copy-ignored`](#wt-step-copy-ignored) and can be filtered with `.worktreeinclude`.

The swap uses `rename()` for each entry — fast regardless of entry size, since only filesystem metadata changes. If the worktree is on a different filesystem from `.git/`, it falls back to reflink copy.

    #[command(
        after_long_help = r#"Bulk-removes worktrees and branches that are integrated into the default branch, using the same criteria as `wt remove`'s branch cleanup. Stale worktree entries are cleaned up too.

In `wt list`, candidates show `_` (same commit) or `⊂` (content integrated). Run `--dry-run` to preview. See `wt remove --help` for the full integration criteria.

Locked worktrees and the main worktree are always skipped. The current worktree is removed last, triggering cd to the primary worktree. Pre-remove and post-remove hooks run for each removal.

## Min-age guard

Worktrees younger than `--min-age` (default: 1 hour) are skipped. This prevents removing a worktree just created from the default branch — it looks "merged" because its branch points at the same commit.

```console
wt step prune --min-age=0s     # no age guard
wt step prune --min-age=2d     # skip worktrees younger than 2 days
```

wt step prune --dry-run

```console
wt step prune

    #[command(
        after_long_help = r#"Moves worktrees to match the configured `worktree-path` template.

## Examples

Preview what would be moved:

```console
wt step relocate --dry-run
```

Move all mismatched worktrees:

```console
wt step relocate
```

Auto-commit and clobber blockers (never fails):

```console
wt step relocate --commit --clobber
```

Move specific worktrees:

```console
wt step relocate feature bugfix
```

## Swap handling

When worktrees are at each other's expected locations (e.g., `alpha` at
`repo.beta` and `beta` at `repo.alpha`), relocate automatically resolves
this by using a temporary location.

## Clobbering

With `--clobber`, non-worktree paths at target locations are moved to
`<path>.bak-<timestamp>` before relocating.

## Main worktree behavior

The main worktree can't be moved with `git worktree move`. Instead, relocate
switches it to the default branch and creates a new linked worktree at the
expected path. Untracked and gitignored files remain at the original location.

## Skipped worktrees

- **Dirty** (without `--commit`) — use `--commit` to auto-commit first
- **Locked** — unlock with `git worktree unlock`
- **Target blocked** (without `--clobber`) — use `--clobber` to backup blocker
- **Detached HEAD** — no branch to compute expected path
