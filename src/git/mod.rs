// Permit count of 4 was chosen based on:
// - Typical CPU core counts (4-8 cores common on developer machines)
// - Empirical testing showing 25.6% improvement on 4-worktree repos
// - Balance between parallelism and mmap contention

// Heavy operations protected:
// - git rev-list --count (accesses commit-graph via mmap)
